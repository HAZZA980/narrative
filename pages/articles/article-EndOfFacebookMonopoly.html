            Facebook has held the monopoly on the social media industry since its creation in 2004. Its rampant spread
            among American ivy league schools skyrocketed Facebook to number one on the app store. Its continual growth
            is yet to cease as over two billion users (or a quarter of the world’s population) are currently registered
            on the site. This has resulted in Facebook having excessive influence over user attitudes, elections, free
            speech and other moral dilemmas. With Facebook’s failure to protect its users and mishandling of contentious
            societal issues, Facebook’s monopoly is now facing significant challenges and unless drastic measures, will
            likely diminish in a few short years.
            <br><br>
            Facebook was founded by Mark Zuckerberg and his two roommates whilst studying at Havard in 2004. Facebook
            was not the first website that aimed to connect people. Sites such as MySpace and Friendster offered a
            similar service but the irresistible aspect of Facebook was exclusivity. Only students with verified Harvard
            email addresses were allowed access. The Facebook as it was called then, was the biggest thing on the
            campus. It was so successful that within seven months, the Facebook expanded its reach to include other
            universities in the United States, including Stanford, Columbia, and Yale subsequently reaching one million
            users by year’s end. By accumulating extensive data from its users, Facebook was able to create individual
            user experiences by showing more relevant posts therefore increasing user interaction and time spent on the
            site. By 2005, Facebook expanded to include universities in the United Kingdom, starting with Cambridge
            University. This marks the beginning of Facebook's availability outside of the United States.
            <br><br>
            With the number of users proliferating at an unprecedented rate, Facebook removed the requirements regarding
            the use of a university or high school email address in order to access the site, therefore allowing anyone
            aged 13 and older with a valid email address to sign up. By increasing the user base, this allowed Facebook
            to accumulate more data for analysis, which over time provided greater insights into user behaviour,
            preferences, and interactions which improved the overall functionality of the site. Facebook remained one of
            the fastest growing companies in history, impressively doubling in size every year for its first six years,
            which left Facebook in a powerful position when the time came to expand its ecosystem.
            <br><br>
            Facebook’s success did not go unnoticed. Other social media sites followed the same ethos of Facebook but
            added their own stamp on the social media industry. Twitter (launched 2006) restricts the users to express
            themselves in a succinct 144 character tweet whilst Instagram (launched 2010) primarily focuses the users to
            upload pictures and provides a selection of filters and tools to enhance the images. Seeing the vast amount
            of users these sites racked up, Facebook looked for acquisition opportunities, not only to expand their user
            base but also to gain market share from potential competitors.
            <br><br>
            This led to a series of bold acquisitions starting with Instagram in 2012. After monitoring the success of
            the photo sharing app for many years, Facebook agreed a $1 billion acquisition fee. This was shortly
            followed by the acquisition of the popular messaging service WhatsApp in 2014 for $19 billion. Facebook was
            attracted to both of these mobile-centric platforms because they not only strengthened Facebook’s position
            in the mobile market, but they also provided complementary features and user experiences that aligned with
            the increasing shift towards mobile usage. Also Facebook saw the long-term potential for monetization on
            both WhatsApp and Instagram. At the time of the acquisitions, the platforms were not generating significant
            revenue however Facebook aimed to leverage their user bases and engagement to explore advertising and other
            revenue-generating opportunities in the future. By bringing these platforms under its corporate umbrella,
            Facebook not only prevented potential threats to its dominance but also gained a stronger foothold in areas
            where these platforms were leading the market.
            <br><br>
            Having amassed a dataset which contains the personal details of over a quarter of the world’s population, it
            is not surprising that a private company struggles to protect the data to a sufficient level at times. In
            recent years the growing concerns over user privacy and data breaches have increased exponentially because
            of the platform’s involvement in various incidents where user data was mishandled, exposed, or accessed
            without proper consent.
            <br><br>
            The case which dominated the headlines in 2018 was the Cambridge Analytica scandal, which revealed that
            personal data of millions of Facebook users had been harvested without their knowledge or consent, raising
            concerns about data privacy and ethical practices. The data was used as ammunition to target voters in the
            2016 US elections in support of Republican candidate Donald Trump. The same subterfuge was used by right
            wing UK parties to assuage voters that exiting the EU would be beneficial to the future of the country. Data
            breaches and security incidents, such as the one in 2018 that affected approximately 30 million user
            accounts, have eroded user trust in Facebook's ability to protect their personal information.
            <br><br>
            Facebook has faced criticism for its role in the spread of misinformation and fake news, particularly during
            significant events like elections and political campaigns. The platform has been accused of being a tool for
            manipulation, allowing the dissemination of misleading or harmful content that can influence public opinion
            and undermine democratic processes.
            Although Facebook is a social media site, it is reported that 70% of users under the age of 25 get their
            news primarily from Facebook. This leaves a dangerous opportunity for hate groups and extremist parties to
            recruit new members. Controversies related to hate speech, extremist content, and the amplification of
            divisive narratives have also plagued Facebook, with concerns over the platform's ability to adequately
            address and moderate such content.
            <br><br>
            In 2019, a right-wing extremist live-streamed himself committing a mass shooting in two mosque’s in New
            Zealand. The video was shared and reuploaded over two million times making it a challenging task for
            Facebook to remove all instances of it. The AI algorithm was able to catch and remove most instances of the
            video however to circumvent detection, users could simply edit the video by adding a filter or a watermark
            and they remained on the site for an extended period of time. At a conference in 2020, CEO Mark Zuckerberg
            claimed that “the AI algorithms created to combat the spread of misinformation and hate speech only removes
            90% overall, the human moderators are employed to catch the rest.” This statement received understandable
            backlash with lobbyists and survivors of the terrorist attack pushing for faster responses when harmful
            videos are uploaded to the site.
            <br><br>
            This has understandably led to increased scrutiny from governments and regulatory bodies. They are calling
            for greater transparency, accountability and regulation on the platform in order for it to be better
            prepared when situations the the christchurch bomber happen. Independent bodies have launched investigations
            and inquiries into Facebook's data privacy practices and its impact on democracy have been conducted by
            various authorities, including the U.S. Congress, the European Union, and other national governments. This
            has resulted in regulatory actions and fines being imposed on Facebook, such as the significant penalty
            imposed by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in 2019 over privacy violations, accentuating the need
            for stricter oversight and regulation of the platform.
            <br><br>
            Presently, Facebook is slowly declining in terms of market share and user time spent on the app as users are
            finding more exciting features on nascent platforms such as TikTok or the well established Snapchat. These
            are increasing in popularity as Facebook has become a by-word for distrust and misinformation. Many opt for
            the use of the camera focused social media platform as these features as users think this is more
            spontaneous and real compared to the heavily photoshopped and edited images which are omnipresent on
            traditional social media pages. The rise of TikTok despite initially being a Chinese company, has
            skyrocketed into the fight for market share among the behemoths such as the Meta platforms and Twitter.
            Users have become more discerning with what happens with their data and want the security provided by the
            rival companies. Snapchat, who once turned down a billion dollar acquisition by Facebook, has vowed never to
            sell data to third party organisations however that doesn’t mean that they don’t collect data. In today’s
            turmoil it seems like users have no escape if they want to use a social media platform without their data
            being mined.
            <br><br>
            In conclusion, Facebook's journey from an exclusive platform for Harvard students to a global social media
            giant has been marked by unprecedented growth and strategic acquisitions. However, its ascent to monopoly
            has come with significant challenges and controversies, particularly regarding user privacy, data breaches,
            and its impact on democracy. The Cambridge Analytica scandal and instances of misinformation during crucial
            events have eroded user trust and drawn the attention of regulators. As Facebook faces increased scrutiny,
            platforms like TikTok and Snapchat are gaining traction, offering users alternative spaces that prioritise
            authenticity and data security. The decline in Facebook's market share and user engagement underscores a
            changing landscape where users are more discerning about the platforms they choose, signalling a potential
            shift away from the once-dominant social media giant. The challenges ahead for Facebook highlight the need
            for the industry to address ethical concerns and prioritise user protection to ensure a sustainable and
            responsible future for social media.
