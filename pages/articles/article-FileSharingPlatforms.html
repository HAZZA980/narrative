            <strong>The Digital Dawn</strong>
            <br><br>
            Music streaming has undergone a shift of monumental proportions in the previous three decades. From the
            alacrity of local radio to enjoying one’s own eclectic taste via the mediums of iPods and mobiles. These
            changes have made music more accessible and personal to users of all demographics, but who orchestrated this
            paradigm shift and where could it lead us into the future?
            <br><br>
            It was 1995, in the early days of the dot com boom, when entrepreneurs dropped out of college and flocked to
            the digital birthplace of the web. Silicon valley, as it was colloquially known as, was the epicentre of
            development and innovation. The world wide web was becoming a powerful medium to interact, advertise, and
            sell to users across the world. Established entities like Google, Netflix, eBay, Amazon, and Yahoo! played
            pivotal roles as quasi founding figures in the digital emergence.
            <br><br>
            With easy access to the web, users were becoming more tech-literate browsing sites and communicating via the
            web. File sharing had become commonplace within companies which allowed employees to share documents but
            only within the internal intranet network. It wasn’t until 1997 when this novel idea was developed for the
            mainstream audiences.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Scour to Napster: The Evolution of Peer-to-Peer (1997-1999)</strong>
            <br><br>
            Founded by five Computer Science undergraduates from UCLA, Scour operated as a search engine utilising web
            crawlers to find and index downloadable links matching users' search queries. The “peer-to-peer” file
            sharing platform was exclusively tailored for audio files in its early days allowing users to upload their
            own audio files to augment the database. The search engine gained positive recognition as a reliable and
            safe way to listen to the latest pop hits quickly propelling Scour to the echelons of silicon valley.
            <br><br>
            Given the minimal risks and substantial potential associated with file sharing, it emerged as an enticing
            opportunity within the market. With the free flow of capital encompassing Silicon Valley, the number of file
            sharing platforms proliferated in the hope of usurping Scour’s dominant market share. AudioGalaxy, Kazaa,
            Freenet and LimeWire each tried to replicate the success of Scour however only one actually did.
            <br><br>
            In 1999, Sean Parker founded Napster which was analogous to Scour.[2] As Parker was a mediocre coder, he
            teamed up with Shawn Fanning who he met online to design and develop the site. Napster gained preference
            over Scour due to its advanced framework, capable of downloading files in a fraction of the time. One month
            on from its launch, Napster had approximately twenty million users surpassing Scour, Grokster, Gnutella and
            Kazaa making it one of the fastest growing sites of the dot com boom.[1] Napser gained popularity because
            Parker had followed Steve Jobs' ethos to make the website simple and intuitive. Napster also had access to
            unique recordings of songs such as studio tracks and concert bootlegs, making them accessible to the public.
            <br><br>
            Facing the increasing popularity of Napster, Scour repositioned itself, evolving into a multimedia search
            engine which included links to video games, audio files and popular feature length films. They rebranded the
            search engine to the venerable monika - Scour Exchange. By integrating all users onto the same platform, it
            exponentially increased site traffic by millions. However, despite having a two year disadvantage, Napster
            was still the dominant platform, registering approximately 80 millions users at its peak in 2000.
            <br><br>
            Scour did not relish being second however capital was running out. Fortunately, capital was a surplus in the
            late nineties as dot com companies were perceived to be auspicious financial investments. Disney’s Michael
            Ovitz and the Yucaipa Company provided the majority of the much needed funding however after Ovitz sued
            Scour over breach of contract, Scour acquiesced to an unfavourable settlement which stipulated that the five
            founders would relinquish control of the company. Travis Kalanick, the future founder of Uber, was one of
            Scour’s earliest employees and a fellow UCLA undergraduate. He was particularly acrimonious in the months
            which followed, ultimately leading to his departure from the company.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Legal Battles</strong>
            <br><br>
            After the turn of the millennium, both Scour and Napster were duelling for market share. Napster was still
            in its infancy having only been founded in 1999 and yet exceeding beyond all expectations. Scour, under new
            management, expanded in terms of products and personale. The company allocated resources away from the Scour
            Exchange to launch a software product named MyCaster which allowed users to stream audio over Wi-Fi instead
            of having to first download the files and add additional sounds using a microphone input over the original
            media.
            <br><br>
            In December 1999, only a month after Napster launched, it received a lawsuit from the Recording Industry
            Association of America (RIAA) on the grounds of breaching copyright law. The nascent company benefited
            greatly from this serendipitous free publicity which subsequently increased its user traffic especially
            among college students. Metallica and Dr Dre filed separate lawsuits because each artist had unreleased
            music circulating on the site. This was one of the great appeals of Napster that users could listen to live
            concerts and private recording sessions. In court, Napster argued that “this is a war on file sharing
            technologies, not a war on copyright infringement”. Despite their expedient business model, Napster
            continued to operate throughout 2000 burgeoning at a steady rate.
            <br><br>
            Scour were soon beleaguered with the same legal troubles but on a much larger scale. As Scour had included
            videos and movie links to appeal to a larger user base, it inadvertently exposed itself to increased legal
            scrutiny. Scour was collectively sued by thirty-three media companies including the Motion Picture
            Association of America, RIAA and the National Music Publishers Association.
            <br><br>
            The axiomatic nature of the file sharing platforms made it difficult to provide any legal remedy to rectify
            their actions. To elucidate the dichotomy of the two companies; Napster agreed to pay artists and copyright
            owners a $26 million settlement for the unauthorised distribution of their intellectual property whilst
            Scour Exchange was collectively sued for a $250 billion. In September 2000, Scour filed for bankruptcy
            protection. Napster followed suit in July 2001, shutting down its entire network in order to comply with the
            injunction.
            <br><br>
            It wasn’t long until the other peer-to-peer platforms suffered similar fates. Contemporary rivals including
            AudioGalaxy, Kazaa and LimeWire encountered parallel legal disputes concerning copyright infringement,
            mirroring the challenges experienced by Scour. These suits culminated in fines and the immediate closure of
            AudioGalaxy. The latter two companies diverged from the file sharing model in order to comply with the law,
            however neither could generate the same momentum from their earlier years resulting in each filing for
            bankruptcy.
            <br><br>
            <strong>The fall of an Empire</strong>
            <br><br>
            In 2001, the dot com bubble had truly burst. Investors were no longer providing the seemingly bottomless pit
            of capital for developers to explore their business venture and wall street became more discerning in
            choosing which stocks actually had merit instead of backing financially precarious startups. The music and
            film industry rigorously addressed file-sharing services, leading many peer-to-peer platforms to alter their
            business models or file for bankruptcy. Accentuating this, the US government was more rigorous in enforcing
            laws surrounding the use of copyrighted material. Scour and Napster illustrated the severity of breaching
            these regulations, setting a precedent for other companies which equivocate on legal matters.
            <br><br>
            Following the strict regulation of music and films over the internet, file sharing had receded back into the
            shadows culminating in what had been the biggest shift of the music industry ever. The traditional means of
            browsing, purchasing and downloading songs faded into obscurity within a mere three years. Silicon Valley’s
            subversives transformed the music industry by introducing peer-to-peer file sharing, providing users access
            to a wide array of songs from both popular and niche artists. While the upheaval was initially challenging
            for the entrenched record labels, the landscape shift was irreversible. Scour and Napster, despite
            succumbing to legal pressures, had revolutionised the industry, making music a personal and accessible
            experience for all. This pivotal period marked the end of an era and the dawn of a new, digitally-driven age
            in the music industry.
