            Earlier this month, Mark Zuckerberg appeared before congress to testify regarding Facebook’s failure to
            protect its users data from misuse from third party applications. Most notably, the Cambridge Analytica
            scandal.
            <br><br>
            Facebook has been the largest social media platform for over a decade, boasting over two billion active
            users. Including the accumulated number of users among Meta’s other subsidiaries, that number almost
            doubles. However Facebook in recent years has been synonymous with data mishandling, dissemination of fake
            news, disregard for privacy concerns and the most egregious at present: election interference.
            <br><br>
            Cambridge Analytica was the salient reason for the hearing as the political consulting firm illegally used a
            dataset of Facebook users to cajole voters into unusual voting habits. Not only has Cambridge Analytica been
            accused of election interference in the US but also in the EU exit referendum in the United Kingdom.
            <br><br>
            In 2016, Facebook released a new API which allowed third party companies to use users data for more
            efficient marketing purposes. Developers and companies alike exploited this data in order to target and
            manipulate elections. The tactics which Cambridge Analytica’s CEO, Alexander Nix, explored were nothing
            short of valiant, however the data which he was using was illegally obtained. Facebook their faux pas and
            rescinded the third party companies from using the data however at that point it was too late.
            <br><br>
            By providing a dataset of just under 90 million American citizens, this proved to be a irresistible
            opportunity for the Russians to run fake ads to popularise far right politicians and to portray liberal
            candidates as renegade ideologues. Zuckerberg allegedly knew nothing of the evidence surrounding election
            tampering or Russian infiltration on Facebook until after the election and Trump had been elected.
            <br><br>
            The media had a field day uncovering the truth as Facebook released more information from the events in
            2016. In 2017, the cybersecurity division removed over 470 inauthentic accounts and pages associated with a
            Russian troll farm called the Internet Research Agency (IRA). These accounts had run ads and content to
            polarise the American electorate in the attempt to push the scales of democracy to the far right. It was
            revealed that the harmful content may have reached around 126 million users on the platform.
            <br><br>
            Zuckerberg’s COO Sheryl Sandberg, represented the company in many capacities including providing evidence
            before congress to prove that Facebook acted responsibly in handling users data and to establish that there
            was no evidence of partisanship towards presidential candidates in the run up to the elections.
            <br><br>
            Facebook’s reputation started to turn sour and the company was being boycotted by thousands of users.
            Zuckerberg, who is not a confident public speaker, had no option but to try to piece together Facebook's
            fragmented reputation. It was around this time that Zuckerberg implemented the super voting shares structure
            therefore allowing him to retain control over the company even as it went public and its shares were made
            available to the general public. If he had not done this then it can be speculated upon whether a coup would
            have taken place among his senior staff.
            <br><br>
            In recent years Facebook has been a byword for distrust and CEO Mark Zuckerberg is very much at the centre
            of that distrust. With relaxed policies surrounding user privacy laws and hate speech on the platform,
            Zuckerberg has been in a defensive position since 2016.
            <br><br>
            Zuckerberg has more recently expressed that he would like to follow in Bill Gates’ footsteps to become a
            global philanthropist. However choosing to do this will have to come at the right time. As Facebook is
            surrounded in controversy and lawsuits, Zuckerberg will be forever seen as an untrustworthy figure and this
            will cast a shadow on any charity work which he does in the future. He may not have a choice as it looks as
            if there will never be a time when Facebook regains its bruised reputation. By the time a new CEO is chosen
            to right the ship, it may be too late. Especially with the threat of government interference and a potential
            breaking up of the Company.
