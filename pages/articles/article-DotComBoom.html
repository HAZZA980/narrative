            <strong>The Early Internet Landscape</strong>
            <br><br>
            The dot com boom of the late nineties marked one of the most significant industry shifts since the
            industrial revolution. Wall Street, technology companies and just about anyone else who was an ambitious
            investor were making millions from the surplus supply of dot com companies. The internet was just beginning,
            and the most prescient companies were quick to take advantage of the evolving landscape, going from paltry
            startups to an IPO in the short space of a few years. From 1995 to the turn of the millennium, a wealth of
            engineers and software developers had gravitated to silicon valley in the hope of becoming rich and yet
            precipitated the start of a new industry which would ultimately shape the future.
            <br><br>
            In 1991, the internet was not the ubiquitous force which it is today. It was an esoteric technology which
            only the most astute individuals could navigate. The extent of its functionality ranged from viewing static
            web pages to performing simple email communication. Search engines like Lycros, WebCrawler and Yahoo! were
            the catalysts which made the internet accessible by structuring web pages in a user friendly and accessible
            format. They thrived by utilising algorithms which meticulously organised web pages, allowing users to find
            answers to their queries in a fraction of the time it would have previously taken.
            <br><br>
            By having an index of websites available at a moment's notice, the free market was quick to capitalise
            however the number of websites were very limited and the ones that were, were for very niche audiences. Book
            Stacks Unlimited is regarded as the first online book seller however consumers were still rightly sceptical
            about purchasing over the internet. Sales were meagre in comparison to the level only a few years later.
            Pizza Hut had a website from 1992 meaning it was the first fast food delivery service to take delivery
            orders placed online, but again, the dubious reception about the internet resulted in low engagement.
            <br><br>
            <strong>The Dot Com Boom Begins</strong>
            <br><br>
            1995 was the start of what is now known as the “dot com boom”. The number of websites surged. Over the
            course of the first two quarters, users had access to file sharing services, e-commerce websites, food
            delivery, and payment schemes. With increased engagement, the internet became more trustworthy and
            dependable to the average person thus leading to spending more time and eventually money online.
            Amazon and Ebay were among the first to have an online presence which provided the blueprint of online
            selling. If they could make it work, so could others. This became the renaissance of the technological age.
            Startups were blinded with the certain successes which were to come that they were more concerned about
            getting a web presence instead of a unique idea. A benefit at the time was no-one had any relevant
            experience in online selling which provided a level playing field for everyone. The inference at the time
            was that those who got there first were to succeed and the rest would fail. This led to a historic turn of
            events.
            <br><br>
            Entrepreneurs from all over the world hastened to California to start a web company. Silicon valley located
            in San Francisco quickly became the technologic hub for these nascent startups. Office space became a
            valuable commodity leading to rival companies sharing the same buildings. Many tech companies would save
            costs where they could in the early days, using recycled furniture and make-shift desks. Many developers
            could move from company to company as there was such a calling for talented engineers. Many companies
            benefited greatly from sharing office spaces, often leading to mergers and acquisitions. Notably, a
            prominent merger occurred between two online financial-management firms: Confinity and x.com merged in 2000,
            forming what would later be known as PayPal.
            <br><br>
            <strong>The Role of Venture Capital</strong>
            <br><br>
            With e-commerce sales growing consistently, angel investors and Venture Capital (VC) firms quickly
            intervened. The rampant success of companies like Amazon and eBay led to a perception that all web-based
            companies were poised for a successful IPO. With an influx of cash being concentrated on such a specific
            industry this sent the stock market into a frenzy. Tech stocks had sky-rocketed, despite the fact many of
            them were not registering a profit. With inflated stocks not corresponding to revenue or profit, this
            resulted in a false portrayal of the status quo. VC firms such as Benchmark and Sequoia had dozens of
            companies on their portfolio including Zappos, Napster and AOL which were all valued in the six figures,
            however this was not the same story for every company at the time.
            <br><br>
            Many VC’s and angel investors had a parochial outlook when looking for potential investment opportunities.
            The dot com appended to a company's name provided gravitas and an ostensible guarantee of success. Whereas
            in reality, many were yet to have a solid business plan or cash-flow projects. VCs were just as prodigal as
            the entrepreneurs because they followed the same mantra: "profitability didn't matter." In hindsight, with
            millions of dollars being injected into paltry companies, they were almost expected to fail.
            <br><br>
            <strong>The Avaricious Pursuit</strong>
            <br><br>
            In an oversaturated industry, there were a number of entrepreneurs whose primary goal was to make quick and
            easy cash via an acquisition. They wanted to negate the risk of running a company long-term and instead
            focus on a cash-grab. The Samwer brothers were prime examples of the new generation of avaricious founders.
            Their business model included taking the ideas of successful US based startups and cloning them in European
            markets. They created facsimile websites of Amazon, ebay, Zappos and Wayfair and rapidly expanding them in
            Europe, which ultimately lead to the aggrieved companies proposing an acquisition or forfeiting market share
            (which was rarely an option).
            <br><br>
            <strong>Successes and Challenges</strong>
            <br><br>
            With the economic landscape perpetually changing, some companies were more adept at acclimatising to the
            tortuous climate than others. Amazon, Yahoo and ebay were among the most successful as user engagement and
            sales proliferated exponentially. In the short space of a few years, each company had millions of
            customers/users respectively. However with online companies growing at an unprecedented rate, the lack of
            experience of many founders quickly became apparent when they could not fulfil customer demand or assuage
            the VC investors who were losing money.
            <br><br>
            VC investors bear partial responsibility for the inevitable demise of numerous companies. Their investments
            provided the impetus for these firms to pursue premature IPOs, driven by the desire for quick returns. IPOs,
            seen as the pinnacle financial goal, allowed companies to be listed on the stock market. The prevalent
            belief in the auspicious nature of tech stocks led to significant inflation in stock prices. Despite this
            boom, a troubling trend emerged – a lack of correlation between a company's success and its stock price.
            This should have served as a warning sign, indicating potential issues in the market. The dividends from
            these IPOs, while initially providing a steady stream of capital, masked the financial precariousness of
            many startups.
            <br><br>
            <strong>The IPO Rush and Its Consequences</strong>
            <br><br>
            After the turn of the millennium, It was only a matter of time before Wall Street became more discerning.
            The number of investments prodigiously dropped seemingly overnight. A range of pernicious factors gradually
            became salient reasons to withdraw funding. The predominant justification was investors were realising the
            risks of their investments. The general criteria for investment for VC firms included either a substantial
            level of growth, user traffic or profit margin. Once the facade had faded and the economic climate was
            acclimatising itself back to a pre-tech era, VC firms had to reassess their portfolios to adapt.
            <br><br>
            The dot com suffix was no longer a sufficient reason to invest. Companies which were surviving off the
            capital raised in the funding rounds were in danger of liquidation. Even the companies which were generating
            a profit, albeit a small profit compared to the high cost margins soon had their funding relinquished. When
            the first domino fell, all of wall street got nervous which led to a mass exodus of technology stocks. Even
            the most successful from the boom such as Amazon and Ebay felt the impact however they had larger enough
            stockpiles of capital to weather the storm. The inflated stock prices of the companies who had made it to
            IPO were soon declining to their true valuation as more investors sold. The once appealing dot com stocks
            were quickly diminishing to penny stocks.
            <br><br>
            One of the biggest names to rise and fall during the boom was Pets.com. Founded in 1998, it operated as an
            online pet supply retailer, offering a wide range of pet products, including pet food, accessories, and
            supplies. By the year 2000, it had already succeeded in an IPO with a valuation of over $300 million at its
            peak, however just 11 months later it filed for liquidation.
            <br><br>
            <strong>The Aftermath and Lessons Learned</strong>
            <br><br>
            In the ephemeral duration of five years, it is estimated over one hundred billion was invested into start
            ups. When the dust settled at the end of 2001, the NASDAQ had lost a third of its overall value. In the
            months that followed investments were at the lowest point in the past decade. To prevent another dot com
            boom, regulatory bodies like the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) introduced measures to
            enhance transparency and reporting requirements for companies, which affected the willingness of investors
            to invest in unproven startups. The nineties created the biggest opportunity for individuals to gain
            millionaire status but also created the biggest losses since the great depression.
            <br><br>
            We can reflect on this time as the beginning of the technological revolution which continued well into the
            naughties. The advances made in relation to the internet and web searching changed the way we interact with
            the web and influenced the new wave of startups moving forward. The perpetual flow of cash became The
            earliest social media platforms were making waves, leading to a new paradigm of web connectivity. The
            general apathy among VC firms also contributed to the new-age startup culture. All companies needed
            formalised documents to illustrate their potential just to get an audience with any angel investors. Thus
            demonstrates the change of the status quo in the 2000s. Even the most successful class of investors from the
            boom proceeded to be more cautious following the aftermath of the bust. John Doerr of Kleiner Perkins who
            had been the lead investor in Google and Netscape opted to freeze any future investment until the volatility
            of the stock market had subsided.
            <br><br>
            <strong>The Impact on the Tech Revolution</strong>
            <br><br>
            Although it was true that acquiring seed funding was a much more onerous task, founders still persisted in
            the hope of achieving what those before them had accomplished. A revolutionary idea which impacts millions
            of users across the globe. After the tenuous companies had succumbed to liquidation, it accentuated the
            innovative pioneers who would shape the future of technology. The boom delineated many aspects of human
            psychology, profligacy, and the irresistible allure of unchecked consumerism. In the wake of the dot-com
            bubble, Pets.com stands as a stark reminder of both the extraordinary opportunities and pitfalls that marked
            this remarkable era in technological evolution.
