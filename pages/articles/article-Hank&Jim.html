            Few film stars have had the illustrious and perennial careers of Hank Fonda and Jimmy Stewart. Through their
            film debuts in the 1930s, these men grew to be the cornerstones of Hollywood film making. Gaining critical
            acclaim with roles in <i>The Philadelphia Story (1940)</i>, <i>It’s a Wonderful Life (1946)</i>, and <i>Rear
                Window (1954)</i>
            for Jimmy Stewart and equally memorable parts for Hank Fonda in <i>The Grapes of Wrath (1940)</i>, <i>My
                Darling
                Clementine (1946)</i> and <i>12 Angry Men (1957)</i>. With a friendship spanning six decades, these
            undisputed greats
            worked with a myriad of cinema royalty and saw the industry change from the inside.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Early Life</strong>
            <br><br>
            Stewart and Fonda first met in 1932 at the University Players, a summer stock theatre company in West
            Falmouth on Cape Cod, Massachusetts. The University Players was a prestigious theatre group attracting young
            talent from across the country. Fonda was introduced to the profession by Dorothy Brando, an Omaha wife and
            mother with a bad marriage and a drinking problem who also nudged her son, Marlon, into the industry also.
            At university, both boys were closetted loners. They were shy, aloof, laconic and reserved. Fonda was a
            closet intellectual and perfectionist, applying his vast due diligence to every part. Stewart was a far more
            easy going man. He wasn’t a voracious reader, was outwardly affable but mainly imperturbable, rarely losing
            his temper. They first moved in together during their university days. This would become the first of many
            times the two shared a roof throughout their lives.
            <br><br>
            As individuals, the two men couldn’t be more different. Henry Jaynes Fonda was an agnostic trending toward
            atheist who had been raised in a Christian Science household on the plains of Nebraska. James Maitland
            Stewart was a churchgoing Presbyterian from the archetypal Midwest town of Indiana. Fonda was an ardent New
            Deal Democrat, Stewart an equally serious conservation Republican. Very early on in their relationship, it
            was implicitly agreed that they wouldn’t address issues which were considered polarising. Much preferring to
            circumvent contentious issues, neither of the men thought it was prudent to debate topics in which they were
            fervent opposition. This became a trend during their lives. Valuing discretion over contentious issues.
            Indifference is the best remedy in their case. It would seem that these two men are diametrically opposed
            and yet, through the medium of performing, they formed the closest bond two men can have without sharing a
            bed.
            <br><br>
            <strong>The Beginning of a Legacy</strong>
            <br><br>
            After a series of performances at university, Stewart was approached by MGM. He was offered a standard
            beginner’s contract for seven years. Stewart remembered his starting salary as $350 a week, which was good
            money for an unproven kid in 1935. The title of his first movie was Art Trouble. Leaving University players
            proved to be an advantageous decision for both actors as Hollywood soon came knocking on Fonda’s door too.
            Debuting his first film the same year as Stewart, Fonda starred in the romantic comedy <i>The Farmer takes a
                Wife (1935)</i>. Following an array of successes in movies, both men could financially sustain
            themselves taking
            jobs throughout the late thirties. Stewart was more accustomed to the Hollywood lifestyle whilst Fonda pined
            for the theatre. He claimed to do his best work in front of an audience.
            <br><br>
            Success soon came calling in the early 40s. Fonda made a name for himself starring in the cultural hit The
            <i>Grapes of Wrath (1940)</i> which precisely captured the crestfallen tone of Americans during the great
            depression. In the same year, Stewart won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his well-played but
            conventional part in <i>The Philadelphia Story</i>. Headlining the cast was Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn
            so
            Stewart beating both of them to win the Academy Award added gravitas to his name. This was historically
            regarded as an honorary award for being overlooked for <i>Mr. Smith Goes to Washington</i> the previous year
            which
            is subjectively regarded as his best performance hitherto. In 1939, Robert Donat played spoiler and got the
            award for <i>Goodbye Mr. Chips</i>. As we will come to see, the academy always pays their debts in
            accrediting
            overlooked actors.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Relationships</strong>
            <br><br>
            Then as now, people wonder about grown men living together. Generally, they come to one conclusion, as Cary
            Grant and Randolph Scott would find out. (Errol Flynn and David Niven managed to dodge the
            implications.) When Orson Welles arrived in Hollywood to make a screen test, he heard the rumours about Hank
            and Jim. “I thought these two guys were either having the hottest affair in Hollywood, or were the two
            straightest human beings I ever met in my life,” Welles said. Throughout their careers both men have a
            series of flings and marriages with Fonda marrying five times.
            <br><br>
            Being a rising star in Hollywood, Stewart attracted a number of celebrated actresses still in the infancy of
            their careers: Ginger Rogers, Marlene Dietrich, Norma Shearer, Olivia de Havilland, Loretta Young, and Lana
            Turner were among the most notable. Eventually he settled down with Gloria Hatrick McLean who married in
            1949. In the maelstrom of Hollywood relationships, divorces are omnipresent for most (as Fonda would find
            out) but Stewart and McLean were aberrations. Married for almost 45 years before Gloria’s death, Stewart and
            McLean were one of Hollywood’s most devoted couples.
            <br><br>
            Fonda’s dating life was much more tumultuous. His most salient relationship was with his second wife,
            Frances Ford Seymour with whom he had a daughter Jane and a son Peter who both went on to have successful
            acting careers. Frances had an affair with a musician whilst Fonda was away at war leading to the breakdown
            of their relationship. They eventually divorced in 1949 and Frances was admitted to a Sanitorium centre for
            a series of mental illnesses. Alas, committing suicide with a smuggled in razor in 1950. Neither Jane or
            Peter were told the true details of their mothers death but instead spared the inevitable pain that their
            mother had a heart attack. Jane serendipitously found out whilst flicking through a magazine at school which
            mentioned the veridical cause of her mother’s death. Peter remained ignorant of the true reason until he was
            an adult. Stewart moved in with the Fonda’s for a prolonged stay. Ostensibly it was for convenience as they
            were working in the same Hollywood lot at the time, but this was how the men showed their affection for each
            other. Even as god-parents to each other’s children, certain topics were off limits. When asked to discern
            certain details about their mother, Stewart evaded the question and never revisited it.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Hobbies</strong>
            <br><br>
            As roommates in the 30s, they were living on minimal rations of food and stretched every paycheck they
            received. To pass the time in the evenings, they would build and fly model aeroplanes. Fonda would spearhead
            the building and painting of the models whilst Stewart was trusted with flying them once complete. This is
            arguably where Stewart’s passion for flying burgeoned. As technology progressed, they traded their model
            planes in for radio controlled models. Once he had earned enough money from his early films, his penchant
            for flying was sated when he applied for his pilots licence. It was a worthwhile trend in the late 30s for
            actors and actresses to go flying. If not for enjoyment but for practicality reasons in order to get to
            different states more quickly when they were filming. Among the notable pilots were: Tyrone Power, Robert
            Taylor, and Robert Cummings, Ruth Chatterton, Joan Fontaine, and an ex-flame of Stewart and Fonda - Margaret
            Sullavan. After the war, Stewart was hungry for a deeper immersion in flying. He got it when Leland Hayward
            started up an outfit called Southwest Airways. Johnny Swope was the treasurer, and Stewart contributed some
            capital, along with Fonda, Cary Grant, Brian Aherne, Hoagy Carmichael, and producer William Goetz. Hayward
            and his investors cashed out for a substantial profit in 1958, when the company was sold and renamed Pacific
            Airlines.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Off to War</strong>
            <br><br>
            In September 1940, the Selective Training and Service Act, better known as the draft, was signed into law.
            American men between the ages of twenty-one and thirty-six were compelled to register for the first
            peacetime conscription in American history. A month later, Stewart was drafted. Joining the army in the air
            force branch due to his proclivities as a skilled pilot, Stewart was eager to do his duty therefore wanted
            to fly East to the war front. (The air force was not officially its own branch of military until its
            inception in 1947.) Having completed the minimum number of flying hours, he sailed through his training
            program and was issued the rank of Lieutenant. Despite aspiring to be flying bombers, it was determined that
            Stewarts service could be best served by making training movies to aid recruitment. The first film he made
            was named <i>Winning your Wings</i>. A US propaganda film encouraging men to sign up. Testament to his craft
            it is
            estimated that 150,000 men signed up off the back of that short film, which was also nominated for best
            documentary of 1942. Unfulfilled on the sidelines, he spent the majority of time training new pilots before
            his commander finally capitulated by deploying him to England. It was during his deployment that he showed
            remarkable acts of valour flying a number of successful missions. He was awarded the rank of Colonel once
            the war culminated in 1945.
            <br><br>
            Fonda was equally as patriotic. Finishing his contractual obligations with 20th Century Fox, he unilaterally
            decided to sign up to the Navy. Informing the executives at Fox as a fait accompli instead of a debate.
            Against his wishes, Fonda was called back to the production studio. As irascible as he was, the Fox
            executives granted him sabbatical to go to war after making one last film. True to their word, once the film
            concluded, Fonda departed in 1942, heading for Naval intelligence. Upon induction Fonda ranked fourth in his
            class of forty four. He served out the remainder of the war as Lieutenant Henry Fonda working at a Naval
            base. Throughout Hollywood countless other actors enlisted regardless of their importance to their studios.
            The gifted Clark Gable enlisted as a pilot but the motifs behind his enlistment were not as patriotic as
            many would think. After his wife died in a plane crash selling war bonds, it was common chatter that Gable
            would opt for missions with a low chance of survival though the veracity of this claim is debated. The famed
            members of the Army at that time included: Charlton Heston, Kirk Douglas, Lee Marvin, Tony Curtis and Tyrone
            Power. All of which were household names among the studios.
            <br><br>
            <strong>The Golden Decade</strong>
            <br><br>
            Stewart became one of the highest paid actors in the 50s with the help of his agent. His interminable string
            of Hollywood successes would see him as one of the most sought after actors in the decade. Making strong
            connections with directors such as Anthony Mann became fruitful as he starred in a number of successful
            westerns including <i>Winchester ‘73 (1950)</i>, <i>Bend of the River (1952)</i>, <i>The Naked Spur
                (1953)</i>, <i>The Far Country
                (1954)</i>, <i>The Man from Laramie (1955)</i>, <i>Night Passage (1957)</i>. Alfred Hitchcock also aided
            in his rise to
            stardom after <i>Rear Window (1954)</i>, <i>The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956)</i> and <i>Vertigo (1958)</i>.
            The latter was not a
            commercial success and was the last film Stewart did with Hitchock, however did receive the recognition it
            deserved when Hitchcock’s films were revisited by future generations of cinephiles. Stewart wanted to be
            cast in the leading role in <i>North by Northwest (1959)</i> but Hitchcock was already in negotiations with
            Cary
            Grant so the writer Ernest Lehman wrote the part suited to Grant. Arguably, Stewarts only flop of the decade
            was <i>The Spirit of St. Louis (1957)</i>.
            <br><br>
            Fonda shared in this homage to Hollywood stardom after a plethora of well received movies. Despite his
            success, Fonda did not have the same attitude towards movies as Stewart. When asked, he would also choose
            the stage. He was the earlier incarnation of a method actor, embracing every facet of his characters whereas
            Stewart would just act to get his daily bread. Fonda’s passion for the stage was paramount, leading him to
            choose theatre shows over film shoots even if Hollywood was more financially rewarding. <i>The Wrong Man
                (1956)</i>
            and <i>12 Angry Men (1957)</i> were his notable hits but because of his love for the stage, he persisted on
            staying
            in New York instead of moving to Los Angeles. He initially refused the part of Juror no. 8 because he deemed
            the plot too dark. After completing both films, neither were immediate successes. <i>The Wrong Man</i> was
            shot by
            Hitchcock like a documentary, not in his usual stylistic niche. <i>12 Angry Men</i> was the only film which
            Fonda
            produced. He shot it in three weeks and the production cost £340,000. A remarkably low figure for a film of
            such stature, even for the 50s. After apprehensive reviews, Fonda never produced again but claimed that the
            latter has made him the most money from any of his films financially.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Changing of the times</strong>
            <br><br>
            After a successful decade of films for Stewart, he was now struggling to fit in with the new age. Hollywood
            was changing and the new direction of filmmaking was taking its toll on veteran actors like Stewart and
            Fonda. Film Noir was in the rear view mirror as colour film became the industry standard. Stewart’s swansong
            came in the unlikeliest places. <i>Shenandoah (1965)</i>. It was a story of a tough, patriarchal Virginian
            during the
            Civil War. Many saw this as a fluke hit, probably because it served as family-friendly counter-programming
            amidst the tumult of Vietnam. It amassed a surprising $7.8 million in domestic rentals—Stewart’s last big
            hit. In 1968, even the Air Force recommended that he retired from active reserve. As he got older, there
            were attendant frailties of age to go along with his hearing loss, which had become severe. He had a
            pacemaker, a bad back, minor skin cancers plaguing his daily routines.
            <br><br>
            Fonda, staying true to his passion, opted for roles on stage rather than on camera, though once in a while,
            Fonda would mull over roads not taken, parts he wished he’d played. He would have loved to have played
            Atticus Finch in <i>To Kill a Mockingbird (1962)</i> and he never forgave his agent for rejecting the
            play of Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? without passing the script by him first. He also turned down parts
            in other films, such as <i>Network (1976)</i>, because of the roaring profanity that was required.
            <br><br>
            He moved to California with wife no. 5 - Shirley. Warding off old-age, he took up hobbies such as painting
            and beekeeping to keep active. Enjoying the outdoors prodigiously, he became an environmentalist, obsessing
            over everything in relation to nature and wildlife. Fonda did a one man show at 69 years old and collapsed
            after three weeks due to total exhaustion. Similar to Stewart, Fonda had a pacemaker implanted. Sorrowly,
            this was the start of his health troubles. Over time, his health problems proliferated and the industry knew
            this. In the late 70s, Fonda began the round of awards that signal the approaching end of an artist’s life.
            An American Film Institute Life Achievement Award, a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Los Angeles Drama
            Critics, an honorary Oscar from the Academy at the Fifty-third Academy Awards, recognition from the Kennedy
            Center. On tour in Chicago with First Monday in October in April 1979, Fonda was suddenly beset with pain in
            his left hip, severe enough that he had trouble walking. Biopsies and X-rays revealed it was prostate cancer
            that had metastasized to the hip.
            <br><br>
            <strong>The End of Eras</strong>
            <br><br>
            Fonda died of heart disease on August 12, 1982, at the age of 77. He had been suffering from a chronic heart
            condition for some time and had undergone heart surgery in 1974. Additionally, he had been diagnosed with
            prostate cancer in 1979, which had metastasized. Fonda passed away at his home in Los Angeles, California
            with his wife and children with him.
            <br><br>
            Stewart and McLean was a rare tale of a successful Hollywood marriage. Gloria McLean, died in 1994 at 75
            years old after 45 years of marriage. Gloria’s death precipitated Stewart’s final, definitive retreat from
            the world. He would stop entertaining guests. Phone calls were left unanswered and dinner invitations were
            declined. After Gloria’s death President Bill Clinton called to offer his condolences, but even with his
            hearing aid Stewart couldn’t hear the President. He grew irritated and hung up. He slipped into clinical
            depression. James Maitland Stewart died in his home of a heart attack brought on by an embolism on July 2,
            1997. He was eighty-nine years old—the same age as his father.
            <br><br>
            Despite their clear differences in politics and social issues, Jimmy Stewart and Henry Fonda shared
            remarkable careers on stage and in film. Both men were aloof, implacable, and dedicated to their craft.
            Although reserved as individuals, they expressed fleeting moments of affection in their unique ways. For
            instance, Henry Fonda's relationship with his children was complex, yet he took care of them, shielding them
            from their mother’s suicide in his own way. Peter Fonda, Henry’s son, experienced this firsthand when he
            showcased his first major movie, <i>Easy Rider (1969)</i>, to his father, who reviewed it with the same
            honesty
            he applied to any other film.
            <br><br>
            Professionally, Stewart and Fonda are revered as heavyweight actors of their time, starring in some of the
