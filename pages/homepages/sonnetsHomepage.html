        <h3>Sonnet 1</h3>
        <p><br>For those who can see short days forthcoming
            <br>Witness the mightiness of the earnest;
            <br>Long nights are for those, the unbecoming
            <br>Hopeful reparations once be furnished.<br>
            <br>For the tapestry of time is fickle,
            <br>Take heed to those who dwell in her presence,
            <br>The nights are lost with only a prickle
            <br>In hope, retrieving lost adolescence.<br>
            <br>Hold thy breath in hope of the days to come
            <br>Affinities muted to those long gone.
            <br>Veracity is true for those outcomes
            <br>Hold close for brazen friends to look upon.<br>
            <br>Time is unforgiving, in summers dawn
            <br>Death's incessant shine, controlling his pawns.

        <h3>Sonnet 2</h3>
        <p><br>From winter to winter, death burgeons near,
            <br>Ignorant of year, progeny or blood.
            <br>Hubris and solipsis only grows fear,
            <br>Extricate or liberate if thy could.
            <br>
            <br>Hades manacles to stop wanderers
            <br>fleeing and flying free in the west wind.
            <br>Mine's eye in the eye of thy ponderers,
            <br>defeated in the burden of thy sinn'd.
            <br>
            <br>Black guise disguise human's prudent judgement,
            <br>Forever vindicated of man's urge.
            <br>Lonely darkness shrouds living adjustment,
            <br>Fabled Deities watch in sullen purge.
            <br>
            <br>For all to witness, for the gods to bear,
            <br>Belief is naive or is it to scare?

        <p><br>The end has surpassed the need to go on,
            <br>The purpose is done for once and for all.
            <br>My purgatory is forever gone
            <br>and yet thy will too is fabled to fall
            <br>
            <br>The ice and the snow falls once more;
            <br>an idyllic beauty I've failed to see.
            <br>Heaven for the rich and not for the poor,
            <br>Oh, cold gasps, the place I desire to be.
            <br>
            <br>A place so sweet I long to see again,
            <br>methinks a change of scene is earnt once more.
            <br>Memories fade, replaced with fog and pain,
            <br>A new Tabula rasa to explore.
            <br>
            <br>Now out with the old and onto the new
            <br>Youth is precious and so I think are you

            <br>Though the emnity of one's mighty dreams.
            <br>Those small impacts and big hopes change slightly,
            <br>Introspective voices morph into screams.
            <br>
            <br>Harried and hastened for mine's decision;
            <br>Hoping for the sweet relief of long rest.
            <br>Afterall, it takes a man of vision,
            <br>to see and achieve all which is the best.
            <br>
            <br>Have moment to witness to be present
            <br>Temerity is boldness to be well.
            <br>Journeys are challenges to be content,
            <br>Retrospection says it must be farewell.
            <br>
            <br>Fear is the thorn which we all must conquer
            <br>free ourselves from our eternal anchor

            <br>In pain, transforming flint into a spark
            <br>
            <br>Ah, lonelier then and lonelier now
            <br>But how long must thy reverie await?
            <br>Destiny's cruel but honors thy vow
            <br>Hitherto, one's affliction is too great
            <br>
            <br>Fight back, honorable tribulation
            <br>Fear me for years and years in search of life
            <br>The temerity of thy creation;
            <br>The tears drop only from her bloody knife.
            <br>
            <br>Suffering and pain contrived from one's own

            <br>Days have passed but the memories are sowed,
            <br>Take heed from penance which is long received.
            <br><br>From whence once came the road has been so far,
            <br>Destined for greatness though no hope accrued.
            <br>Ah, what had shone so bright from sun to star,
            <br>The future is fleeting to be renewed.
            <br><br>For now, belief is for the credulous,
            <br>Written by the fatalists in quiet dawn.
            <br>These oaths spurned, known to the Perfidious,
            <br>Beauteous mornings for which God had drawn.
            <br><br>No hope, no belief for solitude's ear,
            <br>Wander'st in the shade, sheds final tear.

            <br>But for your affection and quaint smile?

            <br>Look and see, for your gait is worth the wait.
            <br>Beware, foul demon, for lover’s deep bite;
            <br>The dawn is nigh, and my chance doth too late.
            <br><br>Obey these futures, allow man to dream,
