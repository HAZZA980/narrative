<div class="description">
    <p>In my Creative Writing course, I was tasked with writing a 3000 word story. That's it. No direction,
        characters, themes or allegory mentioned. 'Write a story which is intriguing' were the words of my lecturer.
        I didn't know where to start. I was reading 'The Writers Tale' at the time by Russel T. Davies so alot of my
        thoughts my have stemmed from an idea he mentions in his book. Alternatively, if they are poor, they are
        most probably my own. I had two months to write my story and these blogs take you through my (at times)
        labyrinthine thoughs and ideas. You can read the finished short story <a href="../shortStory/shortStory.html">here</a>

        <div class="blog-content">
            <p>I don’t expect this to be a refined work of art. This is just for me to vent and brainstorm ideas. I
                think it will be interesting to see what avenues I explore and which story lines I abandon for various
                reasons. To explain briefly, I need to write a 3000 word short story for my Creative Writing course at
                Stockholm University. I don’t have any further instructions. Write a short story, how hard can that be,
                right? The deadline is the 20th of April so I have lots of time to think of a story, write it, rewrite
                it and doubt myself at every turn. I am not worried because even if I write a totally crap story, it’s
                still a learning experience and this gives me the opportunity to get some (hopefully) constructive
                criticism. Either way, it’s going to be a journey whatever the outcome.</p>
            <p>First of all, let me get my excuses out of the way. I don’t write much fiction. Or any fiction for that
                matter. I write more articles on books which I have read in order to consolidate my knowledge on a
                particular subject area. The Boston Tea Party, signal transmissions, even network protocols. I find that
                this helps me revise and simultaneously improves my writing. I don’t even read much fiction anymore. I
                started reading consistently during the pandemic and that is when I read the most amount of fiction.
                Anything that was recommended, either by Amazon or Richard & Judy. I really wasn’t fussy. As I started
                widening my vocabulary, I moved on to biographies and a company. They are sort of fictions however it’s
                all true. I was building a computer at the time and discovering a passion for Computer Science. As a
                side note, that was the impetus for me deciding to go to university. These books about Apple, Facebook,
                Twitter, Netflix, and any other technology company became my inspiration for choosing a career. These
                books gradually became my preferred genre, debasing almost all fiction. I still chose to read
                Shakespeare and the classics. Dickens, Austen, Wells, Dumas. I strongly think that anyone who has an
                interest in reading should read these classics from centuries ago. This helped us all understand the
                different vocabulary and the writing styles of each author. Also to appreciate their skills as a
                lexicographer. Their unique styles, their imaginations. Personal favours include H.G. Wells, The Time
                Machine and Alexander Dumas’ The Three Musketeers. I could happily reread these novels but with so much
                literature to choose from, I think it is a waste of time rereading stories which we know the endings of.
            </p>
            <p>Getting back to the short story, my first hurdle is choosing a topic. A rather big hurdle. A completely
                blank slate. Where do I start? Something contemporary? Historical? Who should my character be? Male,
                female, straight, gay, bi, teachers, scientists, artists, royal, poor. How does one decide? I think many
                people write from what they know. In the seminars, it was implicitly stated to write about something you
                like. This is obvious, but still incredibly vague. Does this mean writing about hobbies, or goals? Do I
                still have modern day problems or do I start writing about Sci-Fi creatures and aliens and see where it
                takes me.

                I have been wracking my brain, trying to think of a story line. We needed to provide a short synopsis
                for the seminar including the characters and the blurb. Still waiting for my light bulb idea, I produce
                a half hearted synopsis about a gang who perform a heist on a rich art collector's house. I started
                mapping it out in my head to see if it is doable. There would be five members of the gang- each with a
                specific skill and arcane backstory. I wanted to have their stories intertwined in some way because I
                think the more connections a character has, the more they are relatable. This can sometimes correlate to
                the quality of the story as well. The twist, which I think every story should have, is that the house
                which they are robbing is actually the father of the gang leader. Oooo, father/son conflicts. I’m not
                sure about the quality of this but every avenue is worth exploring at the moment.

                Upon revisiting this story, I have been developing every character and their backstories, trying to
                connect them and explain how and why they know each other. They are thieves, so it is inevitable that
                some of them met in prison. Is that too cliché? The leader of the group has had to cajole and coerce the
                others into helping him because some are out of the game but it is their backstories which provide the
                information on why they are doing it. If this was a film, it would start with an action packed first
                scene of them breaking into the perimeter and gripping the audience with writing one liners which
                portray the characteristics of each gang member. Then it would go back to the main protagonist.
                Smithers. How’s that for a name of an international art thief. Do people instinctively think of the
                assistant to Mr Burns from the Simpsons? Maybe I need to rethink the name. Then the story will continue
                showing Smithers recruiting the rest of the team. As they get on with planning the heist on the art
                collectors house, it will become apparent why each of them has opted to join Smithers. This will include
                themes like money troubles, gambling debts, greed, the rush of breaking the law. This is coming along
                nicely but I still have a lot of wrinkles that I need to iron out. Should the gang all be focused on
                equally? What about a love interest? One of the gang could have grown up with Smithers and has been
                besotted with him for years. She will do anything for him including break the law. This doesn’t exactly
                create a strong female character which is all the rage right now. Smithers is doing this because it is
                his father’s art collection but what if his impetus for stealing the art is because he has been cut out
                of his father’s will. Or his father has remarried and his new wife is wanting to sell the art, so
                Smithers is actually stealing the art to keep them in the family. Maybe it doesn’t have to be that
                complicated. He could just be doing it because he is a thief. More things to think about. I need to
                sleep on it and see what I come up with tomorrow.

                This is difficult. There are so many strands which I am trying to tie together and my current thinking
                is this is far too complex for a 3000 word story. The labyrinthine events which I want to meticulously
                knot together would likely make this a short novella rather than a short story. I won’t be able to get
                the scrupulous details which will accurately explain why each character is taking part in the heist if I
                shorten it. I have spoken to some friends from my course about this and they have come to the same
                inference. I could reduce the gang from five down to three in an attempt to streamline the story. They
                could all be the art collectors' children and their father’s new wife is attempting to sell the art. I
                am going down that route again. I’m still not 100% invested in the idea of a heist as the story. I don’t
                watch many films like Six Underground, or Red Notice or the ocean films and think, that is a truly
                wonderful story. Yes, they are entertaining films but the stories are not gripping. It also helps having
                huge actors and budgets to provide the grip for the audience. Since I’m lacking in both of these
                aspects, that’s why this story needs to be based on a strong foundation where the writing is the sole
                purpose for gripping the readers. I’m going back to the drawing board, because the art heist just isn’t
                sitting well with me.

                I thought I would have a huge epiphany when I had my million dollar idea. Something which would fill me
                with euphoria and erethism. Something that I could put my finger on and say THAT’S IT! The story which
                really stands out from the monotony of mediocre ideas. Characters which I can picture before I have even
                written a word describing them. Their inclinations towards different circumstances. The chemistry they
                have with each other. The dialogue which brings them to life. I have been racking my brain hoping for an
                olive branch for one of these ideas. I don’t know how writers come up with their ideas. I have read
                articles and books on authors explaining their process. Stephen King, Francis Prose, Russell T Davies.
                There isn’t a conclusive blueprint on how to create a good script. The overwhelming conclusion is,
                despite the common fallacy, most ideas are contrived rather than naturally created. I don’t know how
                much I agree with this. Ideas are created from the various stimuli which we are exposed to and then
                exaggerated and developed into fictional stories. Our experiences can spark a seemingly simple idea to
                flourish into an intricate story with spaceships and laser guns with swamp creatures and little green
                aliens and a good and a dark side. Sorry, sorry. I watched Star Wars earlier and it’s evidently still
                fresh in my mind. There are so many variables which can tilt the scales from era defining novels to
                stories which were promising but missed the mark by targeting a niche demographic, or lost the intrigue
                of the audience part way through. The latter fade away to be forgotten whilst the former are remembered
                for centuries. Of course I am hoping for neither of these. Anything this isn’t branded as crap by my
                classmates is the nadir which I will gladly accept.

        </div>
        <div class="blog-content">
            <p>What about Kings and Queens? Of course, there is a plethora of fictional works which has exhausted almost
                every avenue of ingenuity so my story will have to be more about the execution rather than the
                originality. First of all, I was thinking of a historic tale based on the Queen of England. Of course,
                I’m British so it makes sense for me to write about our monarchy. The King has died of a mysterious
                malaise, leaving the throne to his only daughter – Queen X. I haven’t thought of her name yet. I want it
                to be something sweet and yet powerful. If there is such a name. Something with gravitas which
                antagonists will come to fear. I also need it to be something that resembles nobility. A name which
                people will hear and think, yes, I can tell that is a royal by her name. Elizabeth, Mary, Cleopatra.
                Hmm. Queen Sarah. No, forget that. That’s awful. I’ll come back to it later. The Queen is facing a
                revolution as her subjects are revolting against her fathers tyrannical rule. With the King dead, now is
                the time to fight to ensure that they don’t live under a similar rule. This sounds similar to the French
                revolution but for my story, I’m thinking about the Queen slaughtering the proletariat, or at least
                those who have raised arms to the Queen. Is this too imperious? How would the reader react to this? No
                story is 100% awful if the underdog, against all odds, secures a victory. Proper David vs Goliath style.
            </p>
            <p>
                From a writer's point of view, it’s almost like picking low hanging fruit. That’s why I’m more inclined
                to go for a dark twist at the end to shock the reader. Maybe I lure the reader in even further by having
                the Queen portrayed as a stark aberration from her father. Cordial and simpatico nature. She gains the
                trust of her subjects until she snaps. Her benevolence was only a facade for her to flush out her
                fathers adversaries. She executes the anti-royalists and begins her reign of terror. Actually, this is
                turning into a rather interesting plot. The quasi-reformation of the Monarchy makes her subjects believe
                that this is the start of a golden age only for her to follow in her father’s footsteps. Will this make
                the reader dislike the story when I turn the Queen’s likeable character into the antagonist. If done
                correctly, at best, this makes the story venerated. A story which readers can say, it's a good plot
                although not really the ending in which we wanted. This comes back to something which I read in Russell
                T Davies’ book A Writer’s Tale. He says something like, the audience is not a contributor to the story,
                they are merely a bystander. It is not a democracy, it is a dictatorship. The writer’s way is supreme.
                Of course, it helps having the stellar reputation which Russell has. A career of successful projects.
                Can neophyte writers such as myself take this risk. Potentially creating a congenial character which the
                readers fall in love with and suddenly turn them into a imperious dictator. I need to decide whether to
                take this risk.

                So I’ve been awake for 17 hours today. I have been coding from dawn till dusk and my eyes are not
                straight anymore. I need some much needed respite so I have started thinking more about my Kings and
                Queens story. My mind is bubbling with ideas. Not solely about the outlined story above but other
                stories too. I am definitely using the King’s malaise as a starting point because that provides a nice
                segway into the start of a new reign for his daughter Queen X. I don’t even have to provide any dialogue
                between the King and his daughter, I can start the story with the Queen grieving and start painting the
                characters from there. I haven’t decided on Queen X personal character traits yet. Should it be a loving
                relationship between father and daughter or could their conflict be the impetus for Queen X reign of
                terror. I have been flirting with the idea that the Queen is corrupted by power and the mantle of being
                Queen. Her youth proved to be a hindrance in leading the country. As the story progresses Queen X faces
                a myriad of challenges which develops her character and turns her into a wise, dutiful monarch. So far
                this doesn’t sound like a page turn but it’s all about the challenges which she faces. Her character
                development is the centre of the plot. I fear I don’t have the meticulous language required to paint
                such a complex character without including a simple protagonist/antagonist relationship to focus on.
                Also, as I plan to have this set in the 16th or 17th century, I want to include the church in this. Not
                to be a central role but certainly as a reverential periphery entity. I will use just enough religious
                vernacular to beguile the readers into thinking I know what I am talking about. Words like
                ecclesiastical and diocese. It may be contrived but it will add more esteem to my work.

                Queen Annabelle. First of her name. Future Queen of England. Also known as Queen Annabelle, the Valiant.
                How’s that for a royal Moniker. Sweet, venerated, has a certain ethereal affection to it. That’s my
                protagonist. Annabelle is not the name of a malevolent dictator. Long Live Queen Annabelle.

                Where do writers start? Do they have an ending in sight and work backwards to figure out the story?
                Plugging the gaps as they go. Do they focus on the character relationships and write blindly adding
                challenges and protagonists as they go? From what I’ve read from other writers, this is all correct. And
                this is all wrong. There is not a definitive guide. Writing is subjective in nature. It all depends on
                the story which you are trying to tell. The fulcrum of it. Whatever that may be. Find out what will be
                at the heart of the story and then build everything else around it. Maybe a central theme, lust, greed,
                love. Is the story focusing on the characters and their reactions to the events unfolding around them.
                Does the character's thoughts and feelings play a prominent role in how we want the readers to respond.
                Is talking in first person or third person more impactful? Alternatively, will the plot dictate the
                direction in which the story flows, irrespective of what the characters are feeling. So many variables
                that I need to thread together in order to create a story. Most authors play it safe and choose a centre
                point which ideas just proliferate from. Some of the more talented authors can make their stories more
                intricate and have many central points. They can switch narratives, and themes, character POVs whilst
                keeping the story flowing in a linear fashion. It is like spinning plates, keeping track of all the
                characters movements, their problems and visceral behaviours. Add another piece to the overall jigsaw of
                the story every time the narrative is switched.
            </p>
            <p>
                The very best stories culminate in a grand climate in
                which all the loose ends are tied up in a nice little bow and the readers are left thinking “of course,
                how did I not see that coming”. Personally, I’m not much of a juggler. I hope to provide a riveting
                story which keeps the audience gripped. Books like George Orwell’s nineteen eighty-four had the most
                gripping last hundred pages I have ever read. Winston had been captured and he was being tortured by big
                brother. It was an initial shock as I didn’t expect them to be caught in the fashion which they were.
                Furthermore, the ending left me feeling unfulfilled. Sure, it was a congruous end, which perfectly
                captured the essence of big brother and the social status quo but I was expecting Winston to die with
                his dignity and steadfast probity. Sticking it to the man even with his dying breath. But no. Final
                words of the novel, Winston says “I love big brother.” A total capitulation of his character and
                acquiesce to the state. No revolution, no coup d’etat. A memorable ending to a classic novel. I can’t
                put my finger on it, ultimately making it so resplendent. If I could, I would definitely try to
                replicate it. Unfortunately, I’ll have to attribute it to the genius of George Orwell.

                What if the death of the King was the catalyst for war between England and Scotland. I am choosing
                Scotland because the Scots have been wanting independence so who am I to deprive them of this. When the
                King of Scotland comes to pay his respect to Queen Annabelle, his visit can come with the caveat of War
                if the Queen didn’t stand aside for the King to take the reigns. I want the Queen to be a young Queen
                because I think this always creates a better image in the reader's head. Queen Elizabeth II, Queen Mary,
                Lady Jane Grey. All came on the throne at young ages and faced scepticism but proved to be adroit
                leaders. I want Queen Annabelle to be the same. I have been for a walk around Stockholm and I’ve been
                building Queen Annabelle in my head. Not what she looks like or her style of dress but her character.
                The fresh air seems to have sparked some light in my mind of darkness. Poetic? Maybe not for the story.
                Annabelle is the King's young daughter, maybe 22 or 23, which means she’s well educated but her youth
                can introduce a witty and borderline cheeky side to her. I must use the correct adjectives, because I
                don’t want readers to think that she is arrogant or rude. Instead of spoon feeding the reader the
                character traits of the Queen, I think it would resonate more if I had her interact with commoners or
                other nobles and show what she is like so the readers can make up their own opinions. I think it’s
                important that she is kind and avuncular, congenial to her subject type of person. Ultimately, I want
                her to be relatable. I want readers to have a strong connection to her so they care about her fate. Even
                if the rest of the story is poor, I want a strong character representation. I might still decide to kill
                her off, following the Orwellian approach.

                So what could the main conflict be? I’ve been setting the scene for a few hours now. Wandering around my
                flat like I’ve lost something. I have tunnel vision and end up going down the same thought process. I
                like the idea of the King of Scotland wanting to usurp the throne but I need to think of a better raison
                d’etre than because they can. There needs to be more of a reason for the subjugation of an entire
                country than the King of England has died, let's sit on his throne and rule his people. The King of
                Scotland needs a back story which will help the audience grasp what sort of person he is. Why does he
                want the throne if he is already King of Scotland, especially if Scotland fought for independence. It
                doesn’t make sense for the King to turn round and want to join the two nations together again to the
                status quo ante. Megalomania is a great theme to explore. Lots of rabbit holes I could fall down to
                justify the lust for the throne. Is this too cliché though? I feel like this has been done ad nauseam.
                However with that in mind, it does take a person of altered mental state to start away so maybe I should
                just follow the trend and reform it to fit with the context. May need more work on the King's character.
                I also need to think of a name for the King. Preferably something of Scottish heritage. MacDonald,
                McDougall, MacMillan, anything beginning with Mac really … Or is that just thinly veiled racism? Lets
                just call him King S for the time being.

                I been getting excited now, the ideas are flowing like a downhill stream. I have been thinking about the
                first exchange between King S and Queen Annabelle. I don’t want it to be an all out war straight away. I
                want the audience to get an insight into both characters and the motifs that drive them. The battle
                should happen towards the end of the book but not be the main part. I am keen on the King and Queen
                having an amiable exchange almost immediately after the King’s death. He will come to offer his
                condolences however during the course of the exchange, King S makes subtle hints about taking the throne
                because of Queen Annabelle’s inexperience and inequities. Because he’s cunning renegade, he makes it
                sound like he is doing her a favour because running a nation is stoic work. I want to write it like King
                S is giving Annabelle an excuse to extricate herself from the bourdon of the throne. Keeping the
                conversation polite, Annabelle understands the true nature of this request and refuses the offer. This
                is where we can see Annabelle’s sophistry as she retorts with witty remarks about the state of
                Scotland’s unruly state since King S’s coronation.
            </p>
            <p>
                As this is the first meeting, this just sets the
                stage and shows us what the characters stance are. Sort of like dogs, sniffing their intellectual
                arseholes. Apologies for the vulgar language but I thought it was a poetic parable. I haven’t nailed
                down the specifics of the conversation as I’m still drafting but this is certainly a positive start.
                This does make a nice opening for the Kings declaration of war. He’s offered her the carrot so then it’s
                time for the stick. The King goes back to Scotland, summons the ecclesiastical nobles and beguiles them
                into providing funds for the war to come. This is a minor detail which could be cut out but I think it
                would be beneficial for the reader to see the machiavellian nature of the King and it further adds to
                his character. Things are starting to come together nicely.

                The more I think about this story, the more I get excited but also more stressed. Writing can be
                incredibly revealing in one's psych. Is a story about a King's lust for power truly interesting for the
                average reader. What draws a person to a book? What do they think of? Will Kings and Queens be
                interminably linked to upper class snobbery. I need people to have a tabula-rasa when reading this story
                but that is never going to happen unless they suddenly have a debilitating accident and lose their
                memory. The more I think about it, the more sceptical I get. It is hard to have people relate to royals
                because almost none of us have lived that life, or even appropriated that life for a short time. I am
                basing this story around Queen Annabelle who has grown up in line to the throne, privileged by the
                circumstances of her birth and been encompassed in all the appurtenances of royal life. And I’m
                expecting people to have this visceral connection to her character? With the quality of my writing, I am
                either going to portray her as a commoner, at best a bourgeoisie, or if miraculously, I succeed and have
                her walk and talk like a royal, she will be too far-fetched to be brought to life. Part of me wants to
                start again to write something more easier but writing isn’t supposed to be easy. It is so subjective
                that even the very concept is nebulous to us. If I do stick to this plot line, I may well change
                direction to make some of it easier to relate to. Look at me, I’m saying this like I am in line for the
                throne and all you peasants don’t know the luxury of my life!</p>
            <p>
                If only someone could actually be honest
                and tell me if this is indeed a bit crap. I have no idea if I am driving up a blind alley but only time
                will tell. Besides, when you describe a story on paper or to a friend, it all sounds crap anyway. The
                characters haven’t been developed, the particular setting details haven’t been established, I’m
                describing the bare structure of the story. The King of one country wants to annex another country.
                Sounds like … oh yeah, every other war ever to happen in all of existence. The only practical advice I
                have been given which I think has a meagre effect is “the verisimilitude of the story depends more on
                the execution rather than the actual plot”. Simply put, everyone could write a story based on the same
                plot but the quality of the writing is what separates the weak from the good. The best thing to do when
                I’m feeling like this is to drop everything and come back tomorrow. Hopefully, I fall back into
                exuberance over pessimism.

                I can’t get King S out of my head. His back story, how he is the king of Scotland, the reason for his
                aloof character. Well strap in because I’ve had a maelstrom of thoughts about our frightful antagonist
                in this tale. I’ve mentioned already that Scotland has gained their independence, however, what if King
                S was actually not royalty. He became the self appointed king after his successes in the Scottish war
                for independence. He was first a soldier who led the mutinous coup d’etat against the incumbent King of
                Great Britain, (aka. Annabelle’s father). He was a prominent figure in the sedition against England and
                rose through the ranks to power and status. This was the impetus for his megalomania and the raison
                d’etre why he wants to usurp Queen Annabelle. Being born a commoner, he gained a venerated reputation,
                rising to the head of the Scottish Army. When they gained independence, he self appointed himself as
                King of Scotland because he was the most powerful commander in the army. The Scottish people didn’t
                oppose as they trusted King S from his auspicious army record. Fast forward to present day, the King of
                England died and King S wants to extend his power by subjugating the country that once ruled Scotland.
                Also it is a personal vendetta against the old King and his family. Perhaps focusing on the King's back
                story would be better as this seems to open more doors. I need to decide how much of this I am going to
                explicitly mention and what I can subtly hint at giving the reader the tacit information about King S’s
                past.</p>
            <p>
                Also just by the way, my process has guided me, it is evident that this story will be
                affirmatively character based instead of ploy based. I am dwelling far too deeply into how the
                respective monarchs will behave and interact with each other to then shift the focus to the plot and
                take a circumlocution approach to the characters. I am not sure if this will make my task easier or
                harder. I suppose it will only become clear when I actually get around to writing the story. From a
                dogmatic view, plot driven stories seem easier and there are less fastidious details invested in the
                characters, therefore it is not a problem or a hindrance if the reader doesn’t connect with the
                characters. Plot driven stories focus more on the setting and the descriptive nuisances of what is
                happening. The characters are often tertiary and only speak when it drives the plot forward. I am
                already imagining witty lines of dialogue between my two main characters to drop them to tertiary
                elements. I love them too much for that. But who do I love the most to base the story around. It is
                clear that King S will be the antagonist because he is the one instigating the conflict however he does
                seem like the more interesting character at the moment. Rags to riches stories always carry more weight
                in the grand scheme of this. They also seem to be easier to relate to and empathise with. Wait, does
                this mean I should kill King S off to attain the bigger shock to the reader. I guess I don’t have
                everything figured out yet, but these characters are certainly becoming more like real people rather
                than works of fiction.

                I’ve already established the importance of a name. Above all else, it must fit the character. It removes
                the gravitas of a heroine if they are called Shannon or Courtney. No offence if you are called one of
                these names, it is just when I’m writing, I find it hard to picture the little boy in trouble shouting
                “Help, Help me Shannon ''. To figure out King S’s moniker, I’ve been searching for Scottish proletariat
                names from the sixteenth century, hoping one will jump out at me. I built King S to be such a complex
                character: war hero, megalomaniac, politician, King. It seems like there isn’t a name worthy of a man of
                his reputation. Something so bold, yet ethereal, and also remember that it isn't born a royal so that
                scratches Alexander, William and Charles of the list. What about Duncan? Kenneth? Is that Scottish
                enough? I could cheat a little and drop a line saying that he is part English on his mothers side and
                that could be part of the reason he has such disdain. Some superfluous details like his mother left him
                when he was young. King S could be a bastard! Or is that too Game of Thrones-esk. </p>
            <p> Also this does ebb the flow of the story so it will likely be one of those things tacitly expressed to
                the reader instead of
                wasting my word count with the intricacies. The power of a name. Since he is a decorated war hero, he
                should also have a sobriquet affix to his title. King S, the worthy – no forget that. That’s rubbish.
                King S, the mighty, the great, the bold? I feel like some of these have been overused as epithets for
                kings in real wars. It has to be something original. Since he is self declared King of Scotland, I can
                eschew his sanctimonious attributes if he is picking his own epithets. The reader can deduce the King’s
                pretentious tendencies through his actions instead of his speech. King S, the righteous. Hmm. I’ll keep
                thinking.

                When is the right time to start writing? I have painted a vivid picture of the characters in my head.
                Their attitudes and idiosyncrasies towards each other and their subjects. They are coming off the page
                almost in a tangible form. I am overhearing conversations on the metro and can hear Queen Annabelle’s
                witty retort. The way she curtails her steadfast royal zeal to remain composted and guard her true
                feelings. Yes. She speaks with an educated tongue but not in an ostentatious way. After all she is the
                Queen of England and is not a malevolent ruler. She can learn that from her father. Follow in his
                footsteps of bestowing aid and funds to the lower echelons of her kingdoms. Is this too fairytale? It
                does cut through that metaphorical red tape which I had wrapped the Queen up in. The way I have
                described her here makes her likeable and amiable which is what I want. That makes it even more heart
                wrenching if she is in fact the one who meets her premature death at the end. Young and sweet. They
                always make the best martyrs. Back to the question. Should I write about the opening encounter between
                the two monarchs in the next few days. I roughly have an idea on what they should say. Also the
                affectation in which they should say it. It is an important encounter as it sets the stage for the rest
                of the story. Their relationship hasn’t turned into a perturbed vituperation at this point. </p>
            <p>
                My worry is
                I’ll write this early exchange and then I’ll find a gaping plot hole later on in the story. Get wrapped
                up in the why instead of the how. Without a solid lead for an ending, I would be writing blind,
                so-to-speak. In addition, I still need to decide on tertiary characters. It will be an incredibly linear
                story if it is just backwards and forwards between the two monarchs. Because of the Queen’s youthful
                appendage, I think it makes perfect sense for her to have an aide-de-camp. An advisor to – well advise.
                They could be someone who was inherited from her fathers staff and watched Annabelle grow up. Sort of
                like an uncle who isn’t an uncle but is referred to as an uncle. Does that make sense? The bond between
                them could be almost love but in a maternal sort of way. That might be worth exploring. I need to nail
                down the specifics of the entire plot before going off on a tangent. I guess that has answered my
                question. I am hoping that once I have delineated each part, the pieces will nicely slot together. Then
                it’s just a case of choosing the correct words to succinctly move the plot forwards. Of course that’s
                easier said than done.

                I’ve decided. Queen Annabelle is going to die. I’ve made up my mind and no-one will persuade me
                otherwise. After shadowing her character for the majority of the story, I think it will be a tidy ending
                to have her killed. I want something that screams capital punishment. Something like the guillotine or
                mauled by lions. Something more colourful than an anodyne hanging. That is too simple, I want the
                readers to cry that she is being subjected to such draconian punishment. Ohh, I’m such a bastard.

        </div>
        <div class="blog-content">
            <p>
                I have been planning out the scenes for the story. The fact that I am limited by the 3000 word cap, adds
                another proviso to my writing. How long should each scene be? Do I need to add mini descriptive
                paragraphs between each scene to ease the flow of the story? I have tried to predict the word count for
                each scene as well but that is like predicting who’s going to win the world cup. I have no idea until it
                comes to writing it. Within 3000 words, I have six main scenes:</p>
            <p>
                <i>- Scene One (200-400 words) </i>- At the Kings death bed<br>
                Queen Annabelle mourning the loss of her father who has died of an unexplained illness. This just sets
                the scene and describes the Kings character and what a monumental loss it will be for the kingdom and
                hints at the perilous event to come.</p>
            <p>
                <i>- Scene Two (400-700 words)</i> – The great hall<br>
                King S of Scotland visits Queen Annabelle days after to pay his condolences. On the surface a seemingly
                amiable exchange however the sub-context moves towards him questioning her ability to reign as the
                monarch. He hints at her inexperience and naivety. Queen Annabelle, being well versed at dealing with
                criticism, stands her ground and fails to take the bait. King S overtly offers to take the mantle of
                King of England until the Queen is married and more mature. Unperturbed, Queen Annabelle thanks King S
                for his condolences and imperceptibly comments on his ephemeral reign on the Scottish throne after
                fighting so valiantly for independence. It is a quasi-annodyne response but overtly informs King S that
                his offer has been refused. Queen Annabelle, maintaining her discretion, wants a modus vivendi to keep
                the peace but will do what is necessary to protect her fathers legacy. King S leaves not declaring
                outright war, but hinting at the events to come.</p>
            <p>
                <i>- Scene Three (300-400 words) </i>– King S castle in Edinburgh<br>
                King S has gathered the Scottish nobles and priests to inform them of the Queen’s ignorance at his
                ersatz-benevolent offer. He persuades them that she is an unfit queen and will be a disgrace to the
                Christian religion as she is unmarried and her legitimacy is in doubt. She must be removed from the
                throne at once in order to protect the church. King S informs the nobles that Scotland will usurp Queen
                Annabelle for the English throne and annex England to join the new Scottish empire. All the information
                which he tells them is erroneous and serves as a ploy to beguile them to accepting his plans for war. He
                then sends word to Queen Annabelle that he is declaring war on the English for the crown.</p>
            <p>
                <i>- Scene Four (400-600 words) </i>- The battle of London Town<br>
                Scottish forces are marching towards the English citadel. The English haven’t enough time to mobilise or
                to provide effective countermeasures. A siege commences with the palace standing strong for several
                days. The menial English forces are no match for the phalanx of the Scotts. Queen Annabelle and her
                loyal guards defend the palace, facing overwhelming odds.</p>
            <p>
                <i>- Scene Five (300-700 Words) </i> - The Confrontation in The great hall <br>
                The Queen's guards are eventually slaughtered leaving the Queen no option but to capitulate. King S has
                a final face off with Queen Annabelle in the great hall where they met for the first time just a few
                weeks earlier. The Queen, although unperturbed in the face of danger, is smart enough to accept that she
                has lost the battle. She still has the upper hand on King S intellectually and delivers a powerful
                speech citing that King S will never be a worthy king and his lust for power will be his downfall. King
                S offers the Queen an ultimatum. Abdicate and spend the rest of her days in solitude in the tower or
                face death by guillotine. Remembering her fathers astute lessons, she chooses death as she was born a
                Queen, she will die a Queen.</p>
            <p>
                <i>- Sixth Scene (100 - 300 words) </i> - The Queens Execution <br>
                Queen Annabelle faces her execution with dignity and courage, refusing to show any signs of fear.
                Despite her tragic fate, Queen Annabelle's unwavering resolve leaves a lasting impact on her people.
                This is a brief outline of the story and clearly is subject to change. The word count comes to
                approximately 3000 but I think I will spent time on the characters and the dialogue than use the full
                600 words I have allocated for the war. This scene is part of the plot but is not instrumental in
                portraying the characters in the way what I want. Also since writing it down, I am almost certainly
                going to use third person because that way I can delve into further detail on King S’ war council in
                Edinburgh. I am also swaying towards writing it mainly from Queen Annabelle’s side – still using third
                person. I think it would be more impactful seeing the war from a defensive point of view rather than
                from the attacking pov. It feels good having the outline done. Feels like I am making progress.

                Reading this outline. It does seem, how should I put this. Crap. It’s a little two dimensional. The King
                dies, another King wants his lands, he starts a war and defeats the Queen. Is this just the doubt
                talking? I am being constantly told that writers need to be temerity and hubris to create great stories.
                Focus on the here and now and leave the criticism behind. Of course that’s easier said than done. Once
                this story is out there, there’s no retractions or rebuttals. I’m stuck in a spiral of self-deprecation
                and doubt. I am still invested in these two characters but I think I am cognizant enough of my own work
                to realise that something is missing. I’m relying too much on bringing the characters to life which
                curtails the quality of the plot. Jeopardy. That’s what I need. A bit more action or a twist of fate. A
                huge revelation at the end which leaves the reader having to reread earlier parts of the story in order
                to see it from a new perspective. Of course there is a war happening but that is almost a side story as
                it won’t affect the primary characters directly. Is it just a fallacy for writers, that all stories
                should be complex. I’m sure there will be some great books out there which are very linear and yet still
                intriguing. The only problem is, they are probably originals which have defined entire genres; Pride &
                Prejudice, Romeo & Juliet, Twilight. Okay, maybe not Twilight, but do you see my point. I think this is
                just too basic. I was so exuberant a few days ago thinking about the characters that the plot seemed to
                have gotten away from me. I have been coding all day so I can’t think about going back and adding more
                complex plot points tonight.

                After a few days ruminating, I think I need to add more characters to bulk up the plot. The main
                characters are well established, as I’ve done nothing but speak about them for the past fortnight. But
                I’ve been thinking about the aid to the late king of England - (I also need a name for him as well,
                something traditional but not already imbued with royalty) – that has been inherited by his daughter. I
                think that could be an interesting dynamic. Would he pontificate when talking to the Queen, even resent
                her because she does not possess the same bold inclinations as her father? Alternatively, he could
                enamour the Queen in the hope of being ennobled. Maybe that is sharing King S’s cynicism and I want each
                character to be identifiable in their own right. I’m not even sure about if the aid should be male or
                female or non-bin . . . no, no. Let's not bring 21st century politics into a 16th century story. My
                worry with the aid being male is, if he is any age under 40, you put a man next to a woman, we have a
                love story. Even if it isn’t implicitly stated. There will always be that hint of impropriety and that
                could cheapen the Queen’s character. It might be more believable if the aid is in fact female and she
                has been with the Queen for a few short months/years. Is it cheesy to have the Queen think of the aid as
                a sister-like character. Is that too 21st century writing cliché again? I need to go for a walk to try
                and decipher this character further. My best ideas normally come to me when I am out in the Stockholm
                fresh (cold) air. </p>

                Names, why are they so difficult. Pick the wrong name and it will undermine the entire story. Pick a
                common name and it will blend into the background. Pick a good name and it will be immortalised forever
                in pop culture history. There is a reason the royal family has a repository of names for future heirs to
                the throne. These names are venerated and fill the air with a noble disposition whenever called. That’s
                why I am finding it so difficult finding a name that is suited to the characters and fulfil these
                arbitrary stipulations. I’ve been told to start thinking about the tone which I want to set. I don’t
                know if this is something which I can determine before I start writing. Of course I have an
                understanding of the characters and their idiosyncrasies, but to determine the tone of the story seems
                like a monumental task without having written a line of dialogue. This isn’t even me being reticent
                either, I genuinely don’t know. It is determined by too many factors to be able to unequivocally say
                this is the tone and I’m going to stick to it for all 3000 words. Hopefully, the tone will change
                throughout to signify the progression of events and the character arcs of each monarch. Should it be an
                overtly morbid tone set from the off because it starts with Queen Annabelle mourning her father? From
                then on it is all conflict and war. Little time for any joy for our dear Queen. Writers normally find a
                genre and stick to it because they produce their best work using a particular visceral feeling. I
                obviously don’t know what my preferred genre is yet but I feel like monarchy and power are good themes
                to start off with.

                How big a role should the church have in the conflict? Whose side would they be on? Would they remain
                impartial? Should they remain impartial? They are good entities to be impartial mediators between the
                conflicting parties but that doesn’t add much to the story. Unless they are contrarian or renegade
                priests which sounds like a sinister story itself! The faith cannot campaign for war but I’m sure they
                could be coerced by a megalomaniac king if he offers them some much needed capital. Interesting.
                Additional side plot to keep although this may be debased to a passing statement. It would be rude to
                not mention religion when writing in a 16th century epoch. The monarch of England is pious anyway so it
                would make a shock learning that the ecclesiastical leaders are backing the Scots. It’s not that big of
                a bombshell for the readers but a nice bit of window dressing for the plot. I just need to decide how
                big of a role they will play in the grand scheme of things. I’m keeping an open mind on other periphery
                characters as well to bulk up the story. No need to go into a lot of detail when describing them, just
                additional voices to break the monotonous lines of dialogue between the King and the Queen. Since I’ve
                mentioned the King, how about King Finlay for a suitable name? He will earn the epithet of King Finlay
                the Brazen as the story progresses. I like it. Simple, easy to remember, earthy and strong. Also it is
                derived from the Gaelic name Fionnlagh, meaning "fair warrior". God damn it, I love it. I can always
                link in that nice bit of symbolism if the scene warrants it. Gives the character a pretentious ego right
                from the start which suits him perfectly!

                I’ve got it! Queen Annabelle’s aid is going to be of a similar age to the Queen. She will be smart,
                loyal and most importantly, inconspicuous. She will ostensibly be offering up advice for the Queen,
                acting in her best interests – that sort of thing, but wait for it. Because she is auspiciously placed
                as Queen Annabelle’s aid, she had access to the former king – and she POISONED him! She is the reason
                Annabelle is Queen. This impetus behind this traitorous act is that she is actually the daughter of King
                Finlay. Huge revelations! I am getting excited again because it is all starting to fit together like a
                complex maze of deceit, betrayal and family loyalty. In scene two, amidst the first exchange, I can add
                a line to the King’s dialogue like “You have the same tenacious spirit as my daughter. She is about your
                age.” An innocuous statement which adds nothing at the time but incredibly meaningful once the readers
                know who it is. I am putting this revelation in scene five. After the Scots have subjugated the castle.
                The Queen is in chains and the guards have captured her aid. Only when King Finlay walks in and takes
                Annabelle’s aid in a warm embrace. Obviously I haven’t thought through the specifics yet but I like
                where this is heading. I think it will be a better shock if it is revealed through dialogue so I can
                explain the betrayal on the Queen’s countenance. Sitting here now, I like the sound of Lady Sarah
                Parker. Sounds as British as can be. This is done on purpose as she is actually Scottish making Sarah
                Parker, her nom de guerre. Lady Sarah Parker won’t have a primary role throughout the story but I think
                I can drop in certain opinions and strategies suggested to the Queen which will hint at an ominous
                exchange. After the main revelation, the reader should be able to look back and think, oh yes, that
                makes sense. Everything she did was actually because she was an obscurantist. She was intrepid because
                she knew she was in no danger. The plot is sufficiently getting more complex in a good way. Poisoned
                King, check. Ignoble sidekick, check. Hidden identity, check. God, Sarah’s going to be a right bitch. I
                love it.

                I still want more of an impetus for Lady Sarah Parker to go through such enormous lengths to kill the
                King and also to betray the Queen. I was thinking that the former king of England could have fought
                against the Scots in the war for Scottish independence (which the English must lose), but the King
                killed Sarah Parker’s mother and future King Finlay’s wife during The Battle of Loch Vale. The entire
                chain of events was set in motion because the former King of England killed an innocent woman. Twenty
                years later the daughter becomes the King’s daughter’s aid and poisons him. Does this cause any plot
                holes? Makes perfect sense to me. No doubt I’ll run into some irrevocable problems when I come to write
                it and cause me to scrap the entire subplot.

                King James Winterbourne, does that sound consecrated enough for an English Monarch. Also I’m thinking of
                appending the epithet the Valiant from Annabelle to her father. I don’t think she will be on the throne
                long enough to warrant a sobriquet from her subjects. If anything it will be something lame like Queen
                Annabelle the defeated or the unholy. I can drop that in posthumously in the final few lines. (As long
                as I come up with something better than the defeated). I think I am just going to leave her moniker
                bare. It can be overkill, especially as she is Queen for an ephemeral few weeks. But I think King James
                the Valiant has a nice ring to it. With Sarah Parker being the daughter of King Finlay, they need to
                have a family name. They are Scottish born so it has to be Mac or Mc-something. MacDonald, McClean,
                McDougall. McDougall. I quite like that actually. King Finlay McDougall. Has just enough of a hint of
                working class to it. Lady Sarah Parker’s real name will be Lilias. This is the Scottish variation of
                Lily. Lilias and Finlay McDougall. Proper Scottish. Freedom!

                I am at the point now that I think I am ready to actually start writing. I have a ploy, two strong
                characters, a periphery character who adds an extra layer of subterfuge to the unfolding events, the
                laissez-faire ecclesiastical which is being cajoled in exchange for funds. My main concern is this story
                has a limit of 3000 words which means every word needs to be assiduously selected. I don’t have the
                luxury of adding padding which I can trim later. I am also adding another scene between scenes three and
                four to add to my stress. This will only be a short 100-200 word scene between Annabelle and Lady Sarah
                Parker in her chambers. I want Annabelle to reminisce about what her father would do and this gives me
                the opportunity to add more subtle hints to Lady Sarah’s character. She could talk about her father in
                an amiable way but fail to divulge that he is still alive. I want to add more humanity to both
                characters which I think would make Lady Sarah’s betrayal even more egregious at the end. Again, my
                bigger foe is going to be the word count but I won’t know how fractious this will be until I am writing
                it. This additional scene may be cut off if it’s just not feasible. </p>
            <p> As much as I am excited, I am
                falling into a stressful mood again. I don’t doubt that I have a good story. Now it’s down to me to
                actually write it. Finding the right words to describe the mood and scenery precisely. Being succinct
                but also providing a vivid picture so the readers can bring it to life. Like, I’m sure, all writers do,
                I have the nagging voice in the back of my head saying this is going to end calamitously. All this
                brainstorming and hard work will culminate into a story which I have come to despise. In six months
                time, will I look back on it with mirth or will I want to delete it and never write again. God, this is
                crippling. Books should appeal to an audience of all ages, but as I am writing about Kings and Queens,
                they must use language which reflects their status. With this word count caveat, I must avoid
                circumlocution at all costs, but what about using words which, contemporary, were accurate for that
                epoch. Will the common reader understand them? Maybe if I use them judiciously, it won’t disrupt the
                flow as much. The last thing I want, if the reader to be taken out of the story because they can not
                understand the regal vernacular. I have all these thoughts running through my head and I don’t want to
                even start the story today. I need to do it with a clear head without all these doubts chipping away at
                me. Great, that means I should be starting my story, when? Some time next year? </p>

                I have not written a word yet. I haven’t even started a document with project X appending it. I am doing
                all I can to pass the time, but I have nothing to do. No deadlines, no exams, no reason to hasten into
                it. I am coding prodigiously as I can complete my own projects and still get to the end of the day and
                call myself productive. I am reading more than I am writing these days. Authors make it look so easy
                because we don’t see the months of writing, rewriting, plot reviews and editing that goes into a book.
                But after all is said and done, we have this finished novel which makes it all seem worth it. Successful
                writers must be the most hubris people alive. To publish their work. It’s like putting a magnifying
                glass over their innermost thoughts. People judge every word. I envy their confidence. The only thing
                stopping them is themselves. I am my own worst enemy right now. The fear of failure is stopping me from
                starting. I have spent the best part of a month falling down plot holes and developing all the
                characters, thinking of justifications for their actions and finding clear reasons to exculpate the
                antagonists. Still that was all easy compared to the task now.
            </p>
            <p>
                Like many people, I prefer to work with
                deadlines weeks or preferably months in advance but we actually are more productive when the work is due
                in three days. The panic lights a fire under us and that drives us to (hopefully) success. I have just
                finished The Invisible Man by H.G. Wells. He is an author which I admire, because his level of writing
                is not advanced but the content which he is writing about is so incongruous for his time. All areas of
                sci-fi are fair game. He keeps the reader engaged by moving the plot forward with even scenes. Tell me
                how to do this without it sounding crap. Please. Because I have the time, I am leaving the writing
                today, and I’ll tell myself that tomorrow is a new day and even if I do minimal amounts, it will at
                least be a start. That being said, the start is normally the hardest part of the story. That and the
                end. And the middle. I need to accept that the first draft will always be crap. It’s the hours of
                editing and fine tuning the scenes which will make them half decent. I just want to skip to that stage
                where I can criticise my work and then make it better instead of having to go through the initial, this
                is awful – I hate my story, stage.

                I have just read a section in Russell T Davies book where he writes that he doesn’t scrupulously plan
                out a story to the last detail. He goes on to say that this takes the mystery out of writing and that
                the story will flow better if the story is a collation of ideas which have surfaced from actually
                writing the scene. It feels more natural as planned scenes can sometimes be disjointed if it is forced.
                I probably should have read this earlier if I am taking his advice… I have assiduously planned every
                scene, every character and even the character arcs, to a pedantic degree. Russell did mention towards
                the start of the book that there isn’t a one-size-fits-all approach to writing so I have been saved in
                that aspect as I might have just found my first modus operandi in writing. I will let you know if this
                proves to be a benefit or a hindrance when completing scenes. If I wasn’t writing this story for a
                university assignment, I would like to take his advice but for the time being, I want this to be as
                structured as can possibly be. Paradoxically, I haven’t stuck to the de facto method of planning out a
                start, middle and end, or at least consciously thought about it. Annabelle mourning her father and
                introducing the key players is obviously the starting point. I haven’t decided where the middle starts
                and ends and where the finale starts and culminates. Normally the war is the main bulk of the film/book
                but in my script, this is a by-product as I am focusing more on the characters rather than the external
                conflict. I guess this can be the spontaneity in my writing. I’ll let you know if it goes belly-up.

                I am the imitable, I am the original. Is that too poetic for a King? Maybe so. A little fanciful. Still
                it is a nice rhyming couplet. Anyway, I have devised a plan. Because I spent so much time yesterday
                re-editing my work, I am just going to plough on ahead and not worry about the quality of my writing. I
                can go back and edit it to be more succinct after I have the entirety of the story on page. I may go
                over the word count by a fair margin, but once I go back and consolidate parts and rework most of it, it
                should be fine. Famous last words. If I actually stick to this, I should have it all finished by the end
                of the week, however in reality, I’m more pragmatic so I know that it will drive me mad seeing the
                dismal quality of my scenes. Then I’ll have to go back through them and rewrite them so I don’t lose the
                motivation to write the rest of the story. Why is writing so hard? And why does it look so easy? I read
                plenty of books and I think, yeah sure, I could write something like that. I know what all those words
                mean, but then when I do sit down to write, the words escape me. I am left using basic English which
                makes me sound like such an uneducated child. I prefer to be editing because at least that means that I
                actually have the remnants of a story. It’s hard to edit something at the time of writing it. I know I
                am repeating myself in my plan but it is driving me mad knowing that there is crap dialogue which I
                can’t change until the rest of the story is written. For instance:</p>
            <p>
                <i>“I must confess, I have an ulterior motive for my present here today, your majesty”, King Finlay
                    proclaimed. His voice boomed through the halls of the palace. “As your only ally to the north, it is
                    important for us to remain in a bipartisan relationship. It can be a daunting position you find
                    yourself
                    in, at such a tender age. After all, wisdom and experience cannot be inherited.” Queen Annabelle’s
                    eye’s
                    tightened at this subtle insult of her youth.</i></p>
            <p>
                I detest this paragraph. This is the first meeting between the King of Scotland and Queen Annabelle.
                It’s too direct. I know I need to be wary of the word count, but this removes all sense of mystery. Why
                did the King come? What are his intentions? Could this be the start of a bipartisan relationship or is
                this the caveat before the incivility? I will re-edit this to make it much much better but for now, it’s
                a mere placeholder for the dialogue which needs to take place. It moves the story forward and enables
                the King to start taking verbal shots at the Queen. Don’t judge me until you read the final product - I
                know this is bad.

        <div class="blog-content">
            <p>
                I haven’t been writing the story in order. Because I have an itch to write the dialogue before the
                heavily descriptive scenes first I have continued on to write the scene which I added later. I have
                changed the tone of the first exchange between the Queen and King Finlay. Now the Queen has requested
                King Finlay’s presence. I think that would be more accurate for his arrival at the palace because if you
                have gone to war with another country, you wouldn’t then go to pay your respects to his heir unless you
                really had to. So the summons are the excuse for his arrival but also to keep the ostensible peace (for
                the time being) between the two countries. Also the scene with Queen Annabelle and Lady Sarah in her bed
                chamber is more important than I first realised. This is just a short conversation between them both and
                it explains more about the former king's attitude towards the Scots. Spoiler, he didn’t want to go to
                war, in fact, he advocated to give Scotland their independence but due to external factors, he was left
                with no choice but to go to war. It is a short scene but adds a lot to the character of the King and
                justifies why Annabelle has such a different stance towards the King of Scotland. Except now we know
                that the Winterbourne’s shared the same political views, except they couldn’t air them in public because
                it would be frowned upon.</p>
            <p>
                Since we know that Lady Sarah was actually the one who poisoned the late King,
                I have yet to decide if this will have a substantial effect on her demeanour. At first I was thinking
                that she, like Annabelle, would be following in her father's footsteps but after learning about King
                James’ amenable inclination towards the Scots, maybe I will have her show a little bit of remorse in the
                final scene when the Queen is put to death. I still haven’t decided how this will happen but IT WILL
                HAPPEN. I am also quite happy with the quality of the writing. There are some words which I have put in
                as place holders as I couldn’t find a better word at the time, but these are easy to spot because they
                are in italics. Then there are some words which I think fit but could be more specific so these are also
                in italics for me to check over. Scenes as this one can be just as important as the exchanges between
                the monarchs. As it’s a short story, every scene should drive the story forward and reveal something
                more of the characters, but this doesn’t mean that every scene must add a plot twist which drastically
                changes everything. Even short scenes which motivate a character to continue is worth it. Almost every
                book has scenes which are slow and only provide minimal details but because I am writing a short story,
                I want it to be fast paced and gripping. This scene stops and allows Annabelle to think about her
                actions. It also reveals that Sarah was mistaken about King James motifs. It’s coming together rather
                nicely.

                I have completed the first draft for scenes one, two and four. I have been trying to get the tone right,
                especially for scene two. Should the Queen be defensive or bold in the presence of the man who beat her
                father in battle. I initially wanted the Queen to be wise beyond her years, however I think this has
                already been undermined when she summoned King Finlay to the palace in the first place. As I have been
                writing and editing scene two, the Queen is on the back foot, she wants to start peace talks but
                inevitably loses some of her equilibrium when the King keeps dismissing her statements because of her
                youth. I’m trying to get the correct tone for the scene but perhaps it makes more sense for her to be
                naive and less intelligent than King Finlay. This is plausible as the King is much older and also has
                been on the throne of Scotland for around five years. Alternatively, the Queen has been groomed to
                surpass her father so I can’t decide what the power dynamic should be and who should exit victorious.
                Either way, the King will go back to Scotland and beguile the nobles into starting the war. Either
                because the Queen is young and naive or because she is impulsive and arrogant. The way scene two ends,
                precipitates the tone in scene three so I must at least decide this before I start scene three. Key
                points of the exchange include statements which cause the other to lose their temper. For example, if
                the Queen mentions the war first, the Kings can respond:</p>
            <p>
                <i>
                    The Queen met his gaze and calmly explained his summons. “The aperture between our great countries
                    is
                    becoming wider each year. I don’t know the quid pro quo you made with my father but I am wanting to
                    negotiate a fairer, more equitable relationship for all involved. I propose a partnership. A formal
                    declaration of allied status. Our people can rest easy without the threat of another war.” King
                    Finlay’s
                    eyes flicked wide open, almost annoyed at the mention of the war. “Lets not forget, it was your
                    father
                    who started the war, my dear.” “And under your leadership, your people were able to reign
                    victorious”,
                    the Queen responded.</i></p>

                Here the King is visibly perturbed by the first mention of the war, but I think it might be better for
                Queen to be unsettled because she wasn’t there and the King is power hungry and ultimately a warrior.
                Also the King is probably more likely to bring up the war as that is his greatest conquest. Also, it’s a
                reason to get one over on the Queen as he defeated her father. This dialogue moves the story forward and
                it connects the conversation around it but it is very monotone. It is there more to lead us on the next
                important point. I don’t think this will survive future drafts. Actually, I think I can come up with
                something better, I’ve just thought of something now.</p>
            <p>
                <i> “The aperture between our great countries is
                    becoming wider each year. I am ignorant of the agreement you made with my father but I am open to
                    negotiate a fairer, more equitable relationship for all involved. With that in mind, I propose a
                    partnership. A formal declaration of allied status. Maintaining our leadership without the threat of
                    another war looming over our people.” She spoke with eloquence and authoritative poise but the King
                    remained unperturbed. After a moment to digest the Queen’s assertion, King Finlay smirked.
                    “You speak of leadership but you have not the wisdom or experience to validate your words.” Queen
                    Annabelle’s eye’s tightened at this insult of her youth. “The circumstances of one's birth should
                    not
                    determine the status of one’s life. It’s barbaric. Honour and dignity contrived from battle define
                    the
                    qualities of a leader.</i></p>
            <p>
                By adding a short sentence mentioning the King's leadership at the end of the Queen’s statement, I can
                go straight into the King’s denigration of the Queen’s leadership. It also saves word count which is
                important. Removes the dead dialogue, keeps the fast pace. The overall tone favours the King now. He is
                smug and (I would say complacent but he is right to be), almost showing a superiority complex. I am
                satisfied with this for now, but may require further tinkering if I need the Queen to be perceived as
                more intelligent. Although, that could be her character arc … possibly. She was rash and made bad
                decisions at the start of her reign. When she becomes wiser and more acute, it is too late as the
                outcomes from her previous actions catch up with her. I like that. Needs work but a good arc to start
                with.

                These scenes have changed so much in such a short space of time. First I have been perfecting the
                dialogue, making sure that both monarchs have a distinctive voice. The Queen is determined, resolute,
                benevolent, and idealistic whilst King Finlay is experienced, sceptical, pragmatic, hardened,
                traditional, authoritative and cynical. Is that enough adjectives … ? After getting the character voices
                right, I proceeded to shape the scene. Most of the scene was me telling the audience how the characters
                felt, moved and meant by their words and the responses they got from each other. This is a rather dry
                scene so I removed certain lines which were rather direct and replaced them by delineating character
                body language and poise. Instead of repeating myself using the same phrases such as ‘Queen Annabelle
                remained unperturbed at the King’s aloof demeanour’, I replaced these with ‘The Queen maintained the
                King’s gaze, unwilling to submit to intimidation’. Adds better flow and by adding body language, it
                helps the reader actually picture what is going on instead of reading an interview between two
                politicians. I have tried to keep the pacing in mind, as this is a short story, everything needs to
                transpire at lightning pace. I added a short scene in Queen Annabelle’s bed chamber as mentioned in a
                previous post to ground the reader and develop a few plot points. Apart from that ephemeral scene, each
                scene is full of zeal. Exciting. Some days the words just dance onto the page. I know what the salient
                dialogue points will be; I can build the scene around them and build upwards from there. The scene which
                is proving to be the most difficult is the opening … I can’t seem to get the right tone to introduce the
                Queen and Lady Sarah. Meh, I’ll come back to this another day.

                Writing, writing, writing. I’ve been a force of nature today. I’ve had 101 ideas bubbling away in my
                head. My main conflict was do I still with the plan or do I go off on a tangent. I don’t know! I have
                done a little of both, there are a few nice call backs and plenty of suspense and of course one can’t
                have suspense without betrayal. I’ve tidied up scenes 1, 2 and 4. The reason I have written scene 4 out
                of order is because it is a little scene which further adds to the relationship between the Queen and
                her aid. It add the backstory to the war of Scottish Independence which isn’t paramount to the plot but
                good to have. If I end up dwelling on the siege scene, scene 4 will be the first to go unfortunately,
                which will be a real shame because I really like it. The way I’ve written it makes the scene seamlessly
                flow. It’s beautiful. My writing is top tier when I feel like that. Anyway on to today’s progress. I was
                able to complete scene 3 which is when the King is deceiving the nobles back in the Scottish highlands.
                I didn’t know how that scene would turn out but I think after several hours of work, I have managed to
                capture the contrast between the King’s opulence and his subjects' indigence. I want the dichotomy to be
                striking so the readers know exactly what King Finlay’s character traits are. Unfortunately, there isn’t
                much showing when it comes to the King’s character in this scene but I think I have adequately shown his
                personal inclination when interlocking with the Queen in the previous scene. I have started on the siege
                – scene 5 – where the majority of it is just description. No dialogue as I think it cheapens the scene
                and takes the reader out of the moment if I stop and create a conversation between the queen and her
                guards. It was a real challenge having to carry a scene and drive it forward using a plethora of
                different adjectives. Throughout writing this story, I have realised that I use synonymous adjectives
                when describing the characters. When Queen Annabelle is listening to King Finlay speak, she is normally
                purposely holding his gaze and acting stoically. There is only a certain amount of times I can repeat
                words. I certainly cannot repeat words in the same scene. I have used palpable many times as well.
                Normally portraying the Queen’s discontentment or the King’s anomalous behaviour. These will be replaced
                with alternatives during the editing stage.

                The confrontation is proving to be a source of constant consternation for me; to the point where it is
                keeping me awake at night. Lady Sarah is the Queen’s aid and also King Finlay’s daughter. Should scene 5
                culminate with both women being captured and then scene 6 has King Finlay taking the chains of his
                daughter. It’s a crap way to unveil the big reveal but I don’t have anything better as of yet. I wanted
                to portray Lady Sarah as an aloof character but after serving Queen Annabelle for close to six years, I
                don’t think this is possible for her to have been playing a part for so long without getting emotionally
                attached to her Queen. She will always share her father’s politics – or maybe not his politics, but
                definitely offer her perpetual support – so it will be more accurate if Lady Sarah then sheds at least
                one tear for the Queen. It may be more poignant if I leave this reveal till the last scene. The King’s
                character has been built in the previous four scenes as a power hungry, manipulative, war hero and now I
                am expecting the readers to believe that actually he is sentimental and caring for his daughter? I need
                to show that the King has a human side without destroying his character from the rest of the story. I
                have written the first draft for the execution scene as well. That doesn’t hold any new information, it
                just serves as an ending to the story. </p>
            <p>After days of ruminating how the Queen will die, hanging,
                guillotine, drowning, I have decided on good old fashioned decapitation via an executioner. Just so I
                can include the dialogue: Off with her head!. The King sat on the throne with his daughter – now the
                princess of England and Scotland – watching the Queen’s death. The final line is difficult to write. It
                needs to almost summarise the Queen’s reign but not be a victim to retelling the story. I would like the
                Queen’s memory to go on but in reality, she has only been on the throne for a meagre few days. Weeks at
                the very most. She hasn’t done anything significant. She has mourned her father and then foolishly
                informed the King of her naivety and gullible inclinations! I would like to give her a moniker because
                all fabled monarchs have one but it needs to be the right moniker to fit her character. It can’t be
                something generic like the undefeated or the worthy because that isn’t really her. I’ll keep thinking.
                Once I have decided on the big reveal for scene five - I will need to make sure that the execution scene
                leads on fluently. If it’s disjointed, the story will suffer. I need to keep the word count in mind as
                well because I am pushing on 2500 words and 500 words for the most important scene in the story may be
                problematic when it comes to editing. The first confrontation which sets the whole chain of events into
                motion came in at 810 words which is just under a third of the overall story length. Scenes 3 and 4 are
                shorter as they just provide additional details surrounding the King’s backstory and the Queen’s
                father’s backstory. Although nice to have. I think scene 4, where the Queen is reminiscing about her
                father may have to be truncated to make additional room for the confrontation. That, after all, is the
                pièce de résistance of the story.

                I was racking my brain all day trying to think of the best way for the King to recognise his daughter. I
                had hit a dead end – not quite a writer's block but certainly a tabula rasa which I couldn’t circumvent.
                I put off writing for most of the day until I made the decision to start writing, metaphorically down a
                dark alley. Almost as soon as I sat down, I thought of a cunning scene. I’m an idiot. If only I sat down
                to write earlier. Sometimes the best thing to do is just write. Write, even if deep down you know this
                is going to be bad. It just gets the ideas on paper. That normally sparks some other ideas and hopefully
                one will be useful. So, during the battle, Lady Sarah will be in the great hall with the Queen until the
                Queen sends her away. Annabelle thinks she is being kind by offering Sarah the chance to save herself
                but by doing this, she is actually instigating her own downfall. Sarah leaves the great hall and opens
                the gates to the palace, allowing the Scottish army in. This removes all lingering doubts about where
                Lady Sarah stands in relation to her nationalist values. Of course this isn’t going to be implicitly
                mentioned in the Siege scene, I’m going to save that for the confrontation so I have yet another reveal
                to work in. </p>
            <p>By telling Lady Sarah to leave, it allows me to get her to enter the main chambers when the
                Queen has been captured in scene 6. First, the queen will be dismayed that the Scots have captured her
                aid, and then she will be in anguish upon coming to the realisation that she is indeed part Scottish.
                Then the betrayal becomes clear as the King embraces her and introduces her as his daughter. I sometimes
                get lost when deciding what should be explained unequivocally to the audience and which should be
                implicitly assumed. Of course showing instead of telling is ideal however with the constraints of a 3000
                word story, I need to find the right balance because if I showed the audience everything such as King
                Finlay’s upbringing and the history surrounding the Scottish Independence war then this story would be
                closer to 10,000 words. Sometimes I need to be succinct but the key is knowing when. As I’m writing the
                confrontation, I am running out of my word count so I’ve had to make some cuts to the scene. I wanted to
                include the church in the discussion about King Finlay deciding to usurp Annabelle’s throne but that has
                been removed because I simply don’t have the room for it. It almost slows down the narrative too much
                when the King is proclaiming his plans and engaging in a polemic meeting between himself and the Queen.
                It makes no sense for the church to suddenly interject and introduce yet another subplot to the story.
                My initial idea was for the church to acquiesce to the King because he can offer them funds to buy their
                loyalty but that has had to be scrapped. Instead I have just thrown in a few throw away lines when the
                Queen is clutching at straws to win one over on the King before her execution. I particularly like “The
                Church will never agree to a heresy on the throne!”. The King comes back with a clever retort which sums
                up his character exquisitely but you’ll have to read the full story to discern that conversation.

                Writing is an art, not a skill. There is no such thing as a good writer. Of course there are venerated
                writers who have a myriad of credits to their names who are regarded as a safe pair of hands. For
                instance, I would be comfortable handing money over to Russell T Davies to write a gay or sci-fi series
                (or gay sci-fi; he’s not done that yet,) or Guy Ritchie to write a gangster series. (Let's be honest,
                Guy Ritchie is the only reason Vinnie Jones is still an actor.) But back to the point, the more credits
                you accumulate, the more likely you are to be successful. Even if the TV are mostly below par, as long
                as they appeal to one demographic. It can be as niche as you want. There are some writers which I have
                enjoyed but haven’t received the proverbial recognition deserved. That is simply because they appeal to
                me and my genre of work. Writing is an art rather than a skill. It is tacitly learnt instead of
                explicitly taught. The subjective nature of writing can make it the best job in the world and also the
                most rewarding. To sit down and think of the weird and wonderful things that could or could not happen
                and turn them into works of fiction should be the only impetus anyone needs to start writing. However
                this is also the reason people don’t choose to write. They think they aren’t good enough or they don’t
                have a voice or they don’t have a story. All of this is redundant, I think. The most important thing
                about being a writer is actually being disciplined enough to sit down and write. It is inevitable that
                the first draft will be awful, but editing it into a piece that really speaks to people is part of the
                joy of being creative.

            <h3 class="blog-title">Chapter 37 - A Brief Update</h3>
            <h6 class="date">16/04/2024</h6>
        </div>
        <div class="blog-content">
            <p>
                Six days have passed since I last updated you. I have completed a full draft and I have received some
                initial criticisms from the few people who have read it. The quality of the writing was commendable but
                the main concern was finding out when this chain of events happened. I’m not giving each scene a chapter
                title, instead I am inserting an asterisk between each paragraph to signify the changing of the setting.
                However I am leaving it up to the reader to discern the century that this is supposedly taking place in.
                That’s fine, however, the scenes have no time scale and I don’t explicitly mention how much time has
                passed between each scene. For instance, I have the Queen reminiscing about her father’s leadership in
                scene three and then directly following on for then, the siege is beginning. Is this the same night? Is
                the Queen aware of battle commencing? I am looking at adding an additional few lines, just delineating
                the proper timeline so it doesn’t seem as disjointed. This is rather difficult, only because of the word
                limit – after the first draft, I was on 3134 words. I’m allowed to go over the limit by 10% so I am fine
                for now. Future edits, I might find myself having to cut sub-plots out to save words.
            </p>
            <p>I have effectively
                captured the essence of the characters which is great – this was deduced by my readers feedback, I’m not
                just being hubris. I have also changed the arrangement of the scenes to make it flow better. Previously,
                I had the scene with King Finlay back in Scotland as the third scene after his conference with Queen
                Annabelle. This left that additional scene with Annabelle reminiscing of her father with Lady Sarah as
                the fourth scene and following that we go straight into battle. I thought it would be better if the
                Queen and Lady Sarah had their intimate chat straight after the confrontation so that could potentially
                be happening later that day. Also because I haven’t explicitly said what century this is set in but
                tacitly implied it’s mediaeval times, it would take a few days – if not weeks – for King Finlay to get
                to and from the palace. Putting the King Finlay scene where he’s back in Scotland after the initial
                confrontation is ideal because it gives the appearance of being some time later. At the end of that
                scene as well, I have added an additional few lines for King Finlay to say which declares war on the
                English. That then nicely follows on to the next scene which is the siege on the English. The
                potentially gaping plot hole is, does Queen Annabelle know that the Scottish are coming to invade. Does
                she receive word? I need to add some sort of explanation because currently, scene five has the Queen
                primed and ready to fight. It jumps straight into the action because I don’t have the luxury of
                circumventing the word count limit and filling in the gaps. </p>
            <p>It might be inconsequential when looking at
                the story holistically but I don’t want there to be any disparities between what the reader knows and
                what the characters know. Last thing. All mention of the church and their influence on the King’s
                decisions have been removed. It’s a nice detail to have but in the end, it doesn’t add anything to the
                plot. The ecclesiastical nobles were the main competition in disputing the forthcoming war but now I’ve
                changed it to an brave anonymous noble who raises concerns over the ramifications of another war. My
                initial plan was to cut Queen Annabelle’s scene in her bed chambers where she is telling Lady Sarah
                about her father and his regrets over the way he handled the Scottish polemic voicing independence.
                After days of mulling it over, this scene actually adds to the overall story and changes the dynamic
                between Lady Sarah and her inclination towards the Queen and the late King James. I am currently at 3261
                words so I am still on the right side of the word limit.

                I am at that point where the story is done. I have reached my word limit, I cannot add any more detail
                without surpassing the demarcation. However, I have solicited my mother to read it over after the
                amendments and she has elucidated some important points. In the great hall when the revelations are
                starting to unfold, the King admits that Lady Sarah is well placed to influence the Queen’s decisions
                and carry out clandestine actions such as opening the gates to the Scottish armies and poisoning the
                King’s chalice. My mother astutely asked “How has Lady Sarah influenced the Queen”. She is still of
                paramount importance to the plot because of the physical actions she has undertaken to undermine the
                Queen but has she actually influence the Queen’s decisions. Of course, at the time, I equivocated and
                replied with, ‘It’s only 3000 words, I cannot explore every avenue of subterfuge on Lady Sarah behest’.
                However, looking back through the scenes involving Lady Sarah, I think I can inculcate certain decisions
                via Lady Sarah. How exciting. </p>
            <p>
                I thought my story was almost finished but my brain is still ticking away.
                Now, in the first scene, instead of the tone of the scene focusing on the naivety of Queen Annabelle in
                summoning the King of Scotland, that suggestion is postulated by Lady Sarah, so now it is Lady Sarah’s
                fault that the King of Scotland came to England in the first place. She sets the entire chain of events
                into action. I mean, she did anyway because she poisoned the King, but the reader doesn’t know this yet.
                I was always keen on giving the reader subtle hints about Lady Sarah’s allegiance however I didn’t know
                how to do it. The new tone of the first scene allows me to incorporate her perfidy in a perfidious way,
                that the readers will not know of her true inclinations until the final scenes. However if they reread
                the story, they will be able to pick out her insidious actions. God, I’m a talented raconteur.

                Now I almost have the finished story, I have been focused solely on tone and themes. Rereading my scenes
                to make sure that each character is portrayed in the meticulous way that I imagined. Each scene reveals
                something new and I made sure that the overall tone of the writing was consistent. Above all, readers of
                all ages and genres should be able to follow the plot. Before I started, I didn’t pay attention to the
                specific themes which I wanted to portray. It wasn’t contrived. It happened naturally as the story
                developed. The overall character arcs greatly dictated the running themes throughout, for instance, Lady
                Sarah’s betrayal, King Finlay’s lust for power and Queen Annabelle’s desire to be a good Queen. I am
                happy with how each character has developed and after many days of consternation, I’m satisfied at their
                endings as well. (Particularly with the death of Queen Annabelle – you know how much I wanted a public
                execution.) Now, delving deeper into the themes. First and foremost, leadership and sovereignty. Both
                Queen Annabelle and King Finlay grapple with the weight of their positions and the decisions they must
                make for the welfare of their kingdoms. The struggle for control and dominance underscores the theme of
                leadership throughout the narrative. Check. </p>
            <p>Secondly, Betrayal and loyalty are central themes as
                characters navigate the murky waters of political intrigue and personal allegiance. Queen Annabelle
                experiences betrayal from those she trusted most, particularly Lady Sarah, who ultimately proves
                disloyal to her queen. Conversely, Annabelle's steadfast loyalty to her father and her kingdom remains
                unwavering until her untimely demise. Check. Thirdly, the story explores the consequences of conflict
                and war, both on a personal and societal level. The animosity between Queen Annabelle and King Finlay
                escalates into a full-blown conflict, resulting in the siege of the royal palace and ultimately
                Annabelle's execution. The toll of war on individuals and nations alike is portrayed through vivid
                descriptions of battle and the aftermath of conquest. Check. Fourthly, identity and legacy are
                significant themes as characters grapple with their roles and responsibilities in shaping the future of
                their kingdoms. Queen Annabelle strives to uphold her father's legacy while forging her own path as a
                leader. Meanwhile, King Finlay's actions are driven by a desire to solidify his own legacy, regardless
                of the cost to others. Check. </p>
            <p>Last but not least, the theme of justice and morality runs throughout the
                story, as characters confront ethical dilemmas and wrestle with the consequences of their actions. Queen
                Annabelle's steadfast belief in justice and her commitment to her principles ultimately lead to her
                downfall, while King Finlay's Machiavellian approach to governance raises questions about the morality
                of his reign. Check. Overall I think I have covered all the heart wrenching themes which I was broadly
                aiming for. Some writer need to note down every aspect of the story to give them a definitive guide to
                stick to, however this just isn’t my way of writing. I let the themes play out naturally, that way I
                wasn’t forcing anything and I could further refine the themes once I had at least the first draft
                completed. Now bear with me whilst I digress, and I know fine well that I am getting ahead of myself
                here but I think it is interesting to ruminate about, if it was adapted for the screen would it be a
                melodrama or a drama. What’s the difference you may ask? Well, as Michael Grade colloquially put it: a
                character hates his boyfriend, so he goes out, buys a gun, goes to his boyfriend’s house and pulls the
                trigger, but the gun jams. That’s a melodrama. It is the same for a drama, goes out, buys a gun, goes to
                his boyfriend’s house but he physically can’t pull the trigger because he’s too in love. That’s a drama.
                A drama which I may consider writing because that sounds intense! In the tale of sovereignty – how's
                that for a title? - I would describe it as a drama because although there is emotional conflict between
                the characters, the severity of the plot and its weighty themes which I’ve explained above contributes
                to its classification as a drama. The story’s intricate plot, well-developed characters and nuanced
                exploration of political intrigue and personal relationships neatly defines it as a drama.

                So there it is, the end of my 3000 word short story. I hope you have got a thrill from my pages of
                rambling about structure, themes and plot details. Maybe even be inspired by the plethora of rejected
                ideas from this short story. The overwhelming lesson which I have learnt from this process is that
                writing is hard, but the most important parable to remember is it does get easier and the words will
                start flowing. Having the motivation to sit down and write, even if it is only a couple of sentences a
                day, will inevitably improve your craft. There are still many unanswered questions which will always
                have subjective answers. There is no right way of approaching a piece of writing. For this particular
                piece, I planned out every scene before I even wrote a word. I knew what was going to happen and when,
                which ultimately helped me structure my first story. Since finishing, I have started a new piece which I
                am writing spontaneously. No plan, no structure, no ending in sight and it is invigorating seeing where
                this process takes me. Of course, writer's block is our worst nemesis and self doubt. Unfortunately,
                that never goes away. Once one story ends, new characters, new plots and new themes are introduced in
                the next project. Therefore we need to keep our motivation when writing. It will all be worth it when
                we'll look back at our finished stories.
