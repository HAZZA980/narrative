    <h2 class="title">THE ISLAND OF DOCTOR MOREAU - H.G. Wells (1896)</h2>
</section>

            <strong>Introduction:</strong>
            <br><br>
            The island of Doctor Moreau, written in 1896, is H.G. Wells sixth novel in the science fiction genre. Its
            arcane story is indicative to Wells’ other works, guiding the reader to a receptive mindset. This particular
            novel can also be categorised as a horror as it pertains to vivisection and the torturing of animals which
            some find distressing. Sequestered behind the more notable works in Wells’ repertoire such as The Time
            Machine and The War of the World, this novel remains an odyssey into ethics, morality and the boundaries of
            scientific experiments.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Summary:</strong>
            <br><br>
            The protagonist, Edward Prendick, is sailing in the Pacific Ocean when his ship, the Lady Vain, becomes
            damaged, and he is rescued by a passing ship, the Ipecacuanha. After a conflict arises between him and the
            crew of the ship, they abandon Prendick on the island, where he eventually discovers the bizarre experiments
            being conducted by Doctor Moreau. Dr. Moreau, a scientist who has been ostracised by the scientific
            community for his inhuman research, retreats to this private island to continue his experiments. Through
            vivisection and hypnotism, Dr. Moreau creates new species, giving them human-like characteristics and
            intelligence. Prendick, erroneously assuming that Dr. Moreau is turning humans into beasts, is later exposed
            to the truth by the doctor as Prendick was going to kill himself to prevent being experimented on. One of
            Dr. Moreau’s recent creations, the Puma-Man, escapes, leading to a manhunt on the island. Being too strong
            for Dr. Moreau and his right-hand man, Montgomery, the Puma-Man kills both, leaving Prendick in solitude on
            the island. After the deaths of the humans and Prendick's solitude in the house, Dr. Moreau’s creations
            slowly devolve back into the animals they previously were, losing their ability to speak and reverting back
            to quadrupedalism. Prendick dispatches the Puma-Man when he encounters the creature once more as it remains
            a threat to him and the other creatures on the island. After spending the majority of a year on the island,
            Prendick builds a craft and sails off, where he is picked up by a boat and taken back to England. He
            refrains from articulating the intricacies of his journey, fearing he would be branded insane, and seeks
            refuge in scientists who were acquainted with Dr. Moreau, hoping they might believe his tale.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Themes:</strong>
            <br><br>
            Wells explores a myriad of themes throughout the story, most prominently the ethical implications of
            scientific experimentation and the boundaries of morality. Wells delves into questions about the limits of
            scientific inquiry and the responsibilities of scientists towards their creations. Should science be limited
            and scrupulously monitored by a central governing body to prevent presumptuous experiments? Dr. Moreau has
            created many new hybrid species, turning animals into “human beasts” without outside intervention. He has
            secluded himself on his private island because of the collective aversion to his experiments in England.
            Knowing that his actions were anathema to the scientific community, Dr. Moreau’s impetus has shifted to work
            on his theories unbeknownst to the rest of the world. This sequentially leads to another running theme of
            Moreau's hubris and scientific ambition. His relentless pursuit of knowledge and his willingness to
            transgress ethical boundaries highlight the dangers of unchecked scientific diligence. Digressing to the
            beast folk; they grapple with questions of identity and their place in the world, as they struggle to
            reconcile with their innate animal instincts with their burgeoning human-like traits. Taking a step back
            from the intricate aspects of this novel, this theme explores the prodigious question of what it means to be
            human and the ersatz categories which use to distinguish man from beast. Their isolation is almost palpable
            as they are incongruous to human society and alienated from the animal kingdom, leaving them to ponder where
            they fit in the social structure. Their inevitable behaviour accentuates the age-old question of nature
            versus nurture. As the novel examines this dichotomy, it raises questions about whether the creatures'
            behaviour is determined by their inherent nature or by their upbringing and conditioning.

            <br><br>
            <strong>Writing Style:</strong>
            <br><br>
            Analogous to all of Wells' novels, he uses a similar lexicon composed of esoteric and sometimes malapropos
            words, which envisage his deep understanding of the emotions and themes he is portraying to the reader. His
            use of scientific language and terminology adds a sense of realism to an abstract storyline. This is
            expertly displayed when describing Moreau’s experiments and theories, which set the reader on edge. In
            combination with this, Wells’ descriptive arsenal vividly describes the island setting, the laboratory, and
            the grotesque creatures created by Dr. Moreau. These comprehensive descriptions bring the novel to life,
            allowing the reader to imagine the contorted animals on which Dr. Moreau has experimented. Personally, this
            evoked a sense of unease and horror when reading it for the first time. Following the style of his previous
            novels, we are told the story via the narrative of Prendick, a visitor of Dr. Moreau's island. Wells often
            uses the first person and employs the guise of this protagonist recounting the events to the audience. This
            helps us, the readers, to experience his thoughts and feelings. Wells even starts numerous chapters by
            issuing declarations directly to the reader, such as “I cannot remember the details of the preceding
            conversation…” almost giving an excuse for us to speculate about the ambiguity of the aforementioned events.
            Using this particular style of writing enables Wells to add his own social commentary into the novel, which
            doesn’t impact the flow of the narration by Prendick. Wells takes this opportunity to critique and sometimes
            denigrate contemporary society, particularly regarding issues such as scientific ethics, colonialism, and
            the treatment of animals.

            <br><br>
            <strong>Personal Reflection:</strong>
            <br><br>
            The genre of Science Fiction encompasses a broad range of topics from time travel to alien invasions. This
            novel is grounded in comparison but Wells still explores his steadfast obsession with human’s inclination of
            exploration and pushing the boundaries on human knowledge. This novel is different from many of the books I
            have previously read. I was drawn to it because I admire Wells’ writing style and his innate ability to
            describe the most perplexing stories to an unsuspecting audience. As we hear the tale from Prendick’s
            first-person view, we are at the fulcrum of the story and the suspense which Wells’ creates before he
            reveals Dr Moreau’s true purpose on the island is intoxicating to read. The horror element up until that
            point was masterfully executed with descriptions of the beast people and the nascent creatures, establishing
            a clear protagonist/antagonist dichotomy. However, this perception is later revealed to be erroneous. The
            ending was not the cliche ending which I was expecting too. Following the deaths of the two denizens of the
            island, Dr. Moreau and Montgomery, I thought Prendick would rather extricate himself from the burden of the
            island. Instead he finds the courage to hunt the Puma-man which killed his friends. The novel does culminate
            with Prendick escaping from the island and its pernicious secrets, releasing a personal catharsis as I would
            have been disappointed if he remained stranded. This is a relatively short novel, and my only criticism
            involves a somewhat ephemeral exploration into the beast people’s mindset. We could have been made aware of
            their perception and cognizant abilities if the novel was longer. He is, as we know, a vegetarian, therefore
            promulgating the idea of empathy and understanding towards all living beings, regardless of their form or
            intelligence.

            <br><br>
            <strong>Conclusion:</strong>
            <br><br>
            Without having the constraints which prevent one from delving into the darker aspects of scientific
            advancement, Wells explores the potential consequences of unbridled ambition and the ethical dilemmas that
            arise when playing with the building blocks of life. This novel also delves into inscrutable questions such
            as what it means to be human. Is it appearance, knowledge, intuition, free thought? These prodigious
            questions are far too subjective to be agreed upon unanimously, making this book a thought-provoking
            experiment in the real world. Despite its somewhat meagre reputation in comparison to Wells’ other books, it
            is still a classic that helps us understand more about Wells and his reputation as a visionary author ahead
            of his time.
