            <strong>Introduction:</strong>
            <br><br>
            The Metamorphosis is one of Franz Kafka’s most revered books. The Czechoslovakian writer is known for many
            of his horror stories leading to this particular one being banned in a number of conservative countries such
            as China and Russia. Written in 1915 during the height of the first world war, Kafka became well known for
            his imagination and his unique writing.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Summary:</strong>
            <br><br>
            The Metamorphosis begins with Gregor Samsa, a travelling salesman, waking up one morning to discover that he
            has transformed into a giant insect-like creature. Initially shocked and disoriented, Gregor struggles to
            come to terms with his new form and its implications. As he attempts to adjust to his situation, he grapples
            with feelings of alienation and despair, particularly as he observes his family's reactions to his
            transformation. His family, consisting of his parents and his sister Grete, initially tries to care for him,
            but they quickly become repulsed and increasingly neglectful. Gregor's inability to communicate effectively
            exacerbates the growing tension between him and his family. Despite his efforts to maintain his humanity,
            Gregor's physical condition continues to deteriorate, and he becomes increasingly isolated from society.
            Ultimately, Gregor's existence becomes burdensome to his family, and they come to see him as a hindrance.
            The novella concludes with Gregor's death, after which his family experiences a sense of relief and newfound
            freedom.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Themes:</strong>
            <br><br>
            In this short novella, we are exposed to a myriad of themes. A reverent number when we take into account the
            ephemeral length of this book. First of all, Gregor’s transformation into a giant insect leads to isolation
            from society. This becomes a constant theme throughout the book; he must adapt to his solitude. He is still
            in contact with his family, however, his transformation has prodigiously affected his relationship with his
            parents and sister. His sister especially, becomes a caring, sympathetic figure, tending to approach Gregor
            with an open mind and supports him in his condition. His mother, first is sequestered from Gregor by his
            sister and father as they think that it would be too upsetting for a mother to see her child in that way.
            They arrange to supervise Gregor’s interaction with his mother on weekly visits to monitor her reaction. The
            father is initially shocked, analogous to the reaction of Gregor’s sister, however soon becomes unperturbed
            and wants Gregor to leave. The novella delves into the complex relationships and the shifting dynamics as
            they grapple with the transformation and their coming to terms with the implications which it has on their
            lives. The final theme which I am going to focus on is the guilt and responsibilities which each family
            member feels incumbent to act upon. The moral dilemmas which Gregor faces, speaks to his noble character as
            he doesn’t want to become a burden for his family. He formerly worked as a travelling salesman and was able
            to contribute his wage to the family’s upkeep. He must not live the rest of his life being cared for as he
            is not able to work, nor provide any real useful qualities to help his family.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Writing Style:</strong>
            <br><br>
            As this book was written in the early 20th century, the lexicon used is simple, and easy to follow. It is
            not a children’s book per say, however the language used is not complex therefore would be suitable for all
            audiences. We are introduced to Gregor, the main character, who undergoes the metamorphosis. Instead of
            assigning individual appellations to each character, Kafka chooses to denote the characters in subordinate
            roles by their relationship to Gregor, such as Father, Mother, Sister, and cleaner. This keeps the fulcrum
            of the story on Gregor with the family adding additional context. Because of the unique nature of this book,
            it is understandable that the novella is written in third person so we are able to grasp the thoughts and
            feelings of the family. This adds another layer of detail and development to Gregor’s transformation as we
            are shown how it affects the family instead of having to assume. As this story is relatively short and has a
            paltry number of characters, Kafka comprehensively describes the environment and the actions of Gregor using
            brackets to embed more details into the story, enabling us to vividly imagine what Kafka is showing us.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Personal Reflection:</strong>
            <br><br>
            This book intrigued me from the start. The first sentence is “One morning, as Gregor Samsa was waking up
            from anxious dreams, he discovered that in bed he had been changed into a monstrous verminous bug”. This is
            one of the best openings I have ever read. There are no labyrinthine metaphors or superfluous details. Kafka
            is blunt and direct. This grabbed my attention and maintained it throughout the entire novella. The
            relationships Gregor shares with his sister and parents after the transformation become increasingly fraught
            as they grapple with the unfamiliar circumstances and endeavour to determine how long they must endure the
            new status quo. The strain which Gregor has unwillingly put on the rest of his family is almost palpable
            through Kafa’s writing making the narrative a compelling page turner. The ephemeral life span of a bug
            expectedly catches up with Gregor leading to his death. I didn’t think that after the turmoil and pressure
            which has resulted from the metamorphosis, the family would be poignant in grieving Gregor’s death, however
            I was mistaken. Even despite the incredulous reactions of the family, they were still mournful of the death
            of their beloved son and brother. They remembered him as he was instead of the creature he became.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Conclusion:</strong>
            <br><br>
            Franz Kafka’s novella, The Metamorphosis provides a stark insight into loneliness, family bonds and guilt.
            Published amidst the chaos of World War I, Kafka's masterpiece continues to captivate readers with its
            timeless themes. As we reflect on Kafka's personal background and the historical context of his work, we
            gain a deeper appreciation for the enduring legacy of this literary gem. This book end ambiguously as it
            doesn't provide a definitive resolution to the family's situation or the meaning behind Gregor's
            transformation. After Gregor's demise, his family feels a sense of relief, and they start to plan for their
            future. The story ends with the family contemplating their prospects, suggesting a new beginning for them
            after the traumatic events they've endured. However, Kafka leaves much open to interpretation, allowing
            readers to contemplate the existential and psychological themes raised throughout the novella.
