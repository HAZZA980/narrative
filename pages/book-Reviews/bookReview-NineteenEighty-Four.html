            <strong>Introduction:</strong>
            <br><br>
            George Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four novella was his ninth and final book released before his death in 1950.
            This literary work provides an eye opening insight into a possible reality under an autocratic ruler.
            Orwell’s novella is regarded as an historical classic for its eclectic range of themes such as
            totalitarianism, love, hope and capitulation.

            <br><br>
            <strong>Summary:</strong>
            <br><br>
            George Orwell's "Nineteen Eighty-Four" is a dystopian masterpiece that delves into a chilling vision of a
            totalitarian regime. Published in 1949, the novella explores a range of themes, such as totalitarianism,
            love, hope, and submission, making it an enduring classic. Set in a dystopian society controlled by the
            Party and the enigmatic Big Brother, the story follows the life of Winston Smith, a low-ranking Party member
            who begins to question the oppressive regime's stranglehold on every aspect of life. Winston's journey
            serves as a haunting exploration of the dire consequences of totalitarianism, thought manipulation, and the
            eradication of individualism. Orwell's writing is characterised by its stark and unrelenting style, creating
            a bleak and unsettling portrayal of a world devoid of personal freedom, privacy, and truth. The novel's
            themes of government surveillance, censorship, propaganda, and the suppression of dissent remain eerily
            relevant today, cementing "1984" as a timeless and thought-provoking work of fiction. Throughout the
            narrative, readers are challenged to ponder whether Winston can escape the pervasive grasp of the Party and
            rediscover truth and humanity. The novel's conclusion leaves a lasting impact, evoking a sense of disquiet
            and prompting deep contemplation of the perils of authoritarianism. In "1984," George Orwell crafts a
            literary masterpiece that serves as a cautionary tale about the fragility of freedom and the consequences of
            unchecked government power. It compels readers to reflect on the importance of safeguarding individual
            rights and resisting the allure of oppressive regimes. Orwell's ability to depict a nightmarish world that
            feels unsettlingly close to reality makes "1984" a must-read for those interested in exploring the darkest
            depths of human society and the enduring struggle for individual autonomy and truth.


            <br><br>
            <strong>Themes:</strong>
            <br><br>
            Throughout the dystopian classic, we see a plethora of themes. Especially that of a malignant nature. Orwell
            presents us with a future where a malevolent totalitarianism is the controlling party and declares war on
            any country that is incongruous to their beliefs. The common theme is power. In order to remain in power,
            Big Brother uses fear to suppress the free speech of its citizens making them conform to the national order.
            Orwell elucidated the severity of the big brother state using concepts as the thought police and the
            omniscient eye of Big Brother which is the tyrannical party leader. Our main protagonist makes the egregious
            mistake of acting clandestinely to meet a woman who he falls in love with. The consistent theme is love. Big
            Brother has strict rules regarding the interaction between different sexes, making Winston and Julia’s
            affection for each other dangerous. Despite the laws and state against them, they assiduously navigate their
            relationship away from prying eyes. O’Brien inevitable catches the felonious couple under the watchful eye
            of the state, however Winsons predilection towards Julia does not abandon him - even through torture.
            Through love comes another prominent theme of hope. Hope that Winston will be rescued. Winston’s fortitude
            finally diminishes with his final words being “I love Big Brother ”, meaning the all-powerful state has won.

            <br><br>
            <strong>Writing Style:</strong>
            <br><br>
            Orwell’s classic is written in the 20th century making the eloquence of the writing not dissimilar from the
            common vernacular which we use presently. The dystopian epoch is set in 1984 which is thirty-four years in
            the future from when it was written. Orwell uses the third person in order to capture the ominous
            environment from an external point of view. This allows the audience to witness the essence of the severity
            of the crimes being committed from the point of a bystander, subsequently putting us in the novella keeping
            us as tense as Winston in the scenarios he finds himself in. To intensify the ersatz environment, Orwell
            adds new words to Big Brother’s lexicon such as “doublethink”, “newspeak” and “thoughtcrime”. This
            introduces new concepts to further provide a scope accentuating the disparity between the real world and
            Orwell’s fiction.

            <br><br>
            <strong>Personal Reflection:</strong>
            <br><br>
            I didn’t know what to expect upon starting this book; however the draconian context is expressed right from
            the start, instantly drawing me in. The intricate portrayal of what malevolent, omnipotent state could be
            like was eye-opening and the labyrinth of detail which Orwell includes is laudatory. Writing a complete
            political manifesto which is seemingly abstract enough to remain a work of fiction but also drawing several
            similarities to the present day status quo was disconcerting. With Winston navigating his clandestine
            affairs under the seemingly omnipresent Big Brother, it kept me anxious about his actions.
            Like many similar novellas which I’ve read which conclude with the protagonist extricating themselves from
            the totalitarian regime, I thought this would follow suit. When my prediction didn’t come to fruition, it
            dawned on me why this novella is so widely appraised. Upon finishing this book, I was left with antithetical
            opinions. I thoroughly enjoyed my time reading it, however I was not expecting the complete capitulation of
            Winston’s character. It is an appropriate ending given the scope of the book but it left me feeling uneasy
            in a profound way.


            <br><br>
            <strong>Conclusion:</strong>
            <br><br>
            In conclusion, George Orwell's "Nineteen Eighty-Four" stands as a literary masterpiece that continues to
            captivate readers with its haunting portrayal of a dystopian society ruled by an autocratic regime.
            Published in 1949, this novella explores themes such as totalitarianism, love, hope, and the consequences of
            submission, making it a timeless classic that remains highly relevant in today's world. Orwell's stark and
            unrelenting writing style effectively immerses readers into the chilling world of Winston Smith, a
            low-ranking Party member who challenges the oppressive rule of the Party and its enigmatic leader, Big
            Brother. The themes of government surveillance, censorship, propaganda, and the suppression of dissent
            resonate with contemporary concerns, serving as a stark warning against the dangers of unchecked
            governmental power. The novel's themes of power, love, and hope are masterfully interwoven, culminating in a
            thought-provoking exploration of human nature and the resilience of the human spirit. Orwell's creation of a
            new lexicon, including terms like "doublethink," "newspeak," and "thoughtcrime," adds depth to the narrative
            and underscores the stark contrast between the fictional world and our own.
            As a reader, I was instantly drawn into the nightmarish world Orwell crafted, and I couldn't help feeling a
            sense of unease and apprehension as I followed Winston's journey. The unexpected and poignant ending left me
            with conflicting emotions, but it underscored the novel's powerful message about the fragility of freedom
            and the devastating consequences of succumbing to authoritarianism.
            In today's complex political landscape, "Nineteen Eighty-Four" serves as a stark reminder of the importance
            of safeguarding individual rights and resisting the allure of oppressive regimes. George Orwell's ability to
            create a world that feels alarmingly close to reality makes "Nineteen Eighty-Four" an essential read for
            those who wish to explore the darkest facets of human society and reflect on the enduring struggle for truth
            and individual autonomy. This novella remains a profound and thought-provoking work that continues to
            resonate with readers, reminding us of the enduring relevance of its themes and the need to remain vigilant
            in the face of threats to our freedom and humanity.
