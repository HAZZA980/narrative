            <strong>Introduction:</strong>
            <br><br>
            Pride and Prejudice is one of Jane Austen’s most acclaimed novellas. Centering on love, class, social
            inequality and as the title suggests pride and prejudice. Written in 1813, the novella accentuates the
            hardship and social injustice which women faced and tried to navigate.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Summary:</strong>
            <br><br>
            The Bennet family, comprising Mr. and Mrs. Bennet and their five daughters—Jane, Elizabeth, Mary, Kitty, and
            Lydia—resides in the English countryside. Jane, the eldest and regarded as the most beautiful and amiable of
            the sisters, attracts the attention of Mr. Bingley, an affable and wealthy bachelor, at a local town ball.
            Meanwhile, Elizabeth, known for her wit and strong opinions, forms a less favourable first impression of Mr.
            Darcy, Bingley's close friend, due to his aloof and reserved demeanour.<br><br>
            As Jane's romance with Mr. Bingley begins to blossom, Elizabeth finds herself in frequent company with Mr.
            Darcy, owing to the close friendship between Bingley and Darcy. Their interactions are marked by tension and
            misunderstandings, with their initial conversation ending on a note of incivility. However, as the story
            progresses, Elizabeth's perception of Mr. Darcy undergoes a transformation. Crucially, Elizabeth learns more
            about the history between Mr. Wickham and Mr. Darcy. Mr. Wickham, a charming and personable officer in the
            militia, initially presents himself as a victim of Mr. Darcy's cruelty. He claims that Mr. Darcy denied him
            a promised inheritance and ruined his prospects. This narrative leads Elizabeth to sympathise with Wickham
            and further fuels her unfavourable opinion of Mr. Darcy.<br><br>
            However, through various events and revelations, Elizabeth begins to uncover the truth about Mr. Wickham's
            deceitful character and Mr. Darcy's honourable nature. She discovers that Mr. Darcy had good reasons for his
            actions, including preventing Wickham from eloping with his own sister, Georgiana Darcy, whom Wickham had
            been attempting to seduce for her fortune. These revelations challenge Elizabeth's prejudices and allow her
            to see Mr. Darcy in a new light. The complex history between Mr. Wickham and Mr. Darcy serves as a central
            plot point in "Pride and Prejudice," illustrating the theme of the importance of discerning truth from
            appearances and the impact of personal bias on one's judgments and relationships.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Themes:</strong>
            <br><br>
            Throughout this novella the primary theme is love and the personal prejudices of individuals. Both Mr Darcy
            and Elizabeth Bennett display apathy towards each other however this joint impertinence is for different
            reasons. Mr Darcy is cognizant of Elizabeth’s family social status which objectively means he is superior to
            them because of the fortuitous circumstances of his birth. Elizabeth’s presumptuous inclination upon their
            first encounter further supports his primary inference. Elizabeth’s prejudice is ostensibly well founded
            before the full tale of events are discerned. With a myriad of reasons including Mr Darcy’s distasteful
            words at the ball, and his ill-treatment regarding Mr Wickham, Elizabeth has concluded that these are the
            fundamentals of Mr Darcy’s character. It isn’t until Mr Darcy’s letter to Elizabeth which succinctly states
            the truth of Mr Wickham and the relationship between Jane and Mr Bingley. This turning point in the novella
            focuses on how both characters have been erroneous about their stereotypical prejudices and realise that
            this belies their true selves. The theme of love is explored in its fullest extent as this novella includes
            deceit, betrayal, prejudice and finally revelation.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Writing Style:</strong>
            <br><br>
            This novella is set in the early 19th century similar to when it was written therefore the language used is
            congruous for its era. However Austen manages to capture the dichotomy of class between the opulent Mr Darcy
            and Mr Bingley and the proletariat Bennett family. The narrative encompasses the love affairs of two of the
            Bennett sisters however shifts its focus on the burgeoning relationship between Elizabeth and Mr Darcy as
            their narrative becomes inherently more complex. Austin’s brilliance is accentuated as we peruse into Mr
            Darcy’s character falsely believing that he is an arrogant aloof with a superiority complex because of his
            birth right. He is not adept at participating in social events and taciturn which is interpreted as
            sanctimonious. Austen portrays Elizabeth as a pugnacious free spirit with heightened mental acuity. The
            culmination of the novella is to be admired as the facade of both characters are completely clear leaving us
            with a clear vision of the true nature of each.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Personal Reflection:</strong>
            <br><br>
            Upon reading this for the first time, I was intrigued with the 19th century vernacular and the poise which
            Miss Elizabeth possessed. My previous inferences were along the lines of women were second class citizens
            and they were completely beholden to their husbands or fathers, however as this novella focuses on a family
            with six strong female characters at the fulcrum, I have come to accept that my notions were erroneous. The
            acerbic wit of Elizabeth is to be admired. The unperturbed inclination to speak her mind is inspiring, even
            when she is in the company of her social betters. I particularly enjoyed dismantling the complex Mr Darcy as
            throughout the novella we see that he actions are calculated and benevolent and not pernicious as we are
            initially led to believe. Contrary to our initial perceptions, these are for the good of the Bennett family
            and prove to be a testament to his true character, one that aligns with the values and expectations of the
            era.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Conclusion:</strong>
            <br><br>
            To conclude on a timeless masterpiece, this novella was one of the first books to portray women as powerful
            individuals which in 1813 must have been a shocking revelation. This novella is conservative compared to the
            modern novellas which push the social boundaries such as votes for women and equality, however I imagine it
            was quite a liberal piece of art upon its release. The significance can not be understated as the themes
            exhibited are more pertinent than ever even in today’s perplexing world. The story resonates with so many
            which is why this will remain a classic and an important epoch in women's right for equality.
