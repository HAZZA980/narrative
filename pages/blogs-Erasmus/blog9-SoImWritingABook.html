                Call it an epiphany or a misguided quest towards success. Whatever your judgement, it may be more
                reasonable
                than mine. After experiencing such profound joy from writing my short story, I want to carry on writing
                beyond the occasional blogs and book reviews. It is a skill I deem to be of utmost importance, though
                the
                art of writing seems to be slowly dying, especially with the proliferation of AI and ChatGPT being used
                ubiquitously at home and in professional environments. Nevertheless, I am persisting in improving my
                craft.
                <br><br>
                Now for my motivations. If you have read any of my other blogs, you will know that I am studying for my
                bachelors in Computer Science. However, I have taken the opportunity to do an Erasmus year in Stockholm
                through the De Montfort Global initiative. This wasn’t a dream of mine to study or live abroad, but my
                circumstances and outlook changed sometime during my stay in Leicester, so here I am. While attending
                Stockholm University, I had the opportunity to take courses that are not relevant to my bachelor's
                degree,
                as these modules will not show up on my transcript. Therefore, I was told to do what I enjoy instead of
                what
                I need. Upon that basis, I chose a 15-credit Creative Writing course. As with any course, I have my
                subjective opinion on what went well and what could have been better. (I have written separate blogs
                detailing my opinions of the modules undertaken in my first and second years at De Montfort if you’re
                interested.) During this course, I discussed different elements of writing and the craft of
                storytelling,
                which piqued my interest. We were graded on this course by writing a short story, which gave us the
                creative
                freedom to write about anything we were interested in. After days of brainstorming, I decided to centre
                my
                story around a fictitious Queen of England who faces usurpation from the Scottish Monarchy after her
                father
                dies, leaving his political and regal troubles to his daughter.
                <br><br>
                Not only did I write a compact story, but also a 16,000-word descriptive essay delineating my thought
                process and potential plots. I guess I got carried away.<br><br>
                After writing extensively and enjoying the process of revising and editing my work, I had a few other
                story
                ideas which were either too rich or too intricate to streamline into a 3,000-word short story.
                Therefore, I
                think it is a propitious idea to write a book exploring a plot. Unlike my submission for the course, I
                am
                not fastidiously planning each chapter and focusing on the character arcs to ensure that everything gets
                nicely tied up in a climactic denouement. No, instead I am throwing caution to the wind and writing
                blindly,
                seeing where it takes me. This gives me an opportunity to slip into a dreamy reverie and see what rabbit
                holes my thought process takes me down.

                I have been told not to get overly involved in complex plots, tones, and character language, but to
                ‘just
                write what feels right and the rest will slot into place.’ I’m sure quality authors can write
                spontaneously
                and everything makes sense, but I am precarious in my abilities at this moment. Nevertheless, I am
                following
                this prudent advice and have started writing a story which I think will be interesting.<br><br>
                So the plot. Because it is completely unknown where this will end up, I don’t know the conclusion. What
                I do
                know is that I want this to be a good, coherent story instead of just an exercise of expatiation. I am
                not
                garrulous in person, but by God, I am on paper, so I need to keep a focus in mind for each chapter even
                if I
                am not planning them out in advance. The truncated synopsis is: an introverted boy moves with his mother
                to
                Cardiff, where he finds a friend who brings him out of his comfort zone and they go on wild adventures
                together. The main character then falls in love with his friend and at first doesn’t know what to do
                until
                it is revealed that his friend is already gay, and they live happily ever after. I promise it will be
                better
                when I write it. Look at me, already making excuses for my poor writing. But in my defence, I am writing
                whatever feels right, and every story sounds mundane when described in a succinct few sentences. That is
                just the general direction I am heading in, but it will likely change when I find more intriguing paths
                to
                follow.<br><br>
                I wouldn’t say that this is normally the genre I would follow either. Love story/finding oneself, etc.,
                etc.
                Not much action, but there are certainly many themes I can explore. No, stop, don’t think about themes;
                they
                will just ‘slot into place’ naturally. I hope. Also, I must decree that this plot is totally as nebulous
                to
                me as it is to you. I have no relation to Cardiff for the setting. I’m not Welsh, nor an introvert.
                (Though
                I am a writer, so maybe I am.) I’m not gay nor have a special friend who I go on adventures with. I am
                getting very defensive all of a sudden. Maybe I have been watching too many Russell T Davies shows
                recently,
                so he has subconsciously etched himself into my mind. But just to reiterate, everything about this story
                will be fictional. I think writing is a very personal voyage in itself, with the world seeing into the
                author’s mind based on the words they choose and the tone they adopt. I don’t need the plot to revolve
                around me too.<br><br>
                So we will see how far into this book I achieve. I have been calling it a book throughout because that
                is
                how devoted I am to this idea. However, if I find this to be too taxing or am constricted by other
                commitments, this might only be a short story or a novella instead of a novel. So this marks the start
                of my
                bestseller! Bon voyage!
