                Starting university is always a blend of excitement and trepidation, and my first week in Stockholm has
                certainly been no exception. With a mix of lectures and seminars, I've had the chance to delve into my
                courses and get a feel for what lies ahead. Here’s a candid look at how things are shaping up.
                Design and Information: A Surprise Start
                <br><br>
                My first encounter with the Design and Information course was, to put it mildly, unexpected. Given the
                course's name, I anticipated diving into complex data organization and manipulation. Instead, the first
                lecture introduced us to a task that seemed more suited to a high school project than a master’s degree:
                creating a three-page magazine envisioning society ten years from now. It felt a bit like a
                bait-and-switch. I was bracing for technical jargon and intricate data analysis, but instead, I found
                myself brainstorming magazine layouts.
                <br><br>
                Adding to the challenge is the group work component. I was placed in a team with students from India,
                which initially felt like a promising opportunity to collaborate with diverse perspectives. However, the
                prospect of working in groups is always a mixed bag. As someone who prefers solitary work, I’m hoping to
                switch teams during Thursday’s seminar for a better fit. The dynamic of group projects—especially with
                people I don’t know well—adds a layer of complexity that I wasn’t fully prepared for.
                <br><br>
                The Knowledge Management lecture was a different experience altogether. This course, with its focus on
                essays and literary reviews, promises to be intellectually stimulating. The emphasis here is on forming
                arguments based on scholarly papers, which is a departure from the more straightforward “right or wrong”
                approach of some other courses. The lectures are intimate, often with fewer than thirty students,
                allowing for a more engaging and personalized experience. The professors seem genuinely passionate about
                their subjects, which is a refreshing change from the sometimes disinterested faculty I encountered in
                my previous academic life.
                <br><br>
                However, the prospect of writing multiple essays and a literary review feels daunting. The challenge
                will be not just understanding the material but also developing well-justified arguments supported by
                academic references. It’s not the easiest path, but it promises a depth of learning that’s both exciting
                and intimidating.
                <br><br>
                The seminar for Design and Information, where we created storyboards for a Black Mirror episode, was a
                highlight. Despite my initial disappointment with the course's scope, this seminar was engaging and
                allowed for some creative expression. It was fun, though I was unable to change the group from the
                initial lecture, which was a slight letdown. The itchiness from mosquito bites, a distraction throughout
                the day, didn’t help my concentration, but the session itself was a good break from the more theoretical
                work.
                <br><br>
                This week has been a whirlwind of adjusting to new routines and academic expectations. The Design and
                Information course seems less rigorous than I expected, but the collaborative element is forcing me out
                of my comfort zone. Knowledge Management, on the other hand, seems intellectually robust, offering a new
                way to approach and analyze information.

                In summary, my first week has been a mixed bag of surprises and new challenges. The courses are shaping
                up to be interesting in their own ways, even if they weren’t what I anticipated. As I continue to settle
                in and get used to the academic environment here, I’m looking forward to finding my rhythm and
                hopefully, integrating into a more fitting group dynamic. Here’s to navigating the rest of the semester
                with an open mind and a bit of patience.
