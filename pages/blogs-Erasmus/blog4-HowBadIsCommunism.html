                Now, this may seem like a contentious issue to debate, so first, I think I should explain what got me
                thinking about this subject. I was on the metro heading into the centre of Stockholm to enjoy the early
                signs of spring weather in Sweden. As usual on the metros, there are mendicants soliciting money,
                preachers
                trying to proselytise new believers, or advocates trying to inculcate their chosen cause. Most are
                anodyne,
                which doesn’t warrant a blog post; however, this morning, there was an aberration.
                <br><br>
                'Any communists on the train?' is the phrase I heard. Immediately, my ears pricked up. This man was
                promoting a newly formed party which is accumulating support from various factions around the region. It
                is
                not unusual to hear individuals expressing their religious beliefs or political predilections so
                overtly,
                yet openly asking if there are any communists on the train almost seemed incendiary. I can admit that I
                know
                very little about the party ideology and their motivations despite their auspicious development from
                Marxism; however, the immediate association with communism is negative. As a result, many people will be
                thinking about the Cold War, Stalin, the USSR, and modern-day China – all of which are conspicuous
                indicators of the negative connotations surrounding communism.<br><br>
                But then it occurred to me, if this guy is openly campaigning for the renaissance of the communist
                party,
                are the core fundamentals still relevant? And has it previously failed in the past because of despotic
                rulers operating under the guise of the ideology?<br><br>
                Communism as an ideology has its roots in the works of philosophers and economists like Karl Marx and
                Friedrich Engels. Their work laid out the principles of communism in "The Communist Manifesto," and was
                published in 1848. This manifesto was a call to action for the working class to rise against the
                oppressive
                conditions imposed by capitalism. That line alone is a reason for concern as it implicitly is a call to
                arms, but stay with me.<br><br>
                In the manifesto, the historical development of the class system is described along with the rise of
                capitalism, which they argue exploits the labour of the proletariat for the benefit of the bourgeoisie.
                They
                propose that the inevitable result of this exploitation will be a revolution in which the working class
                will
                overthrow the capitalist system and establish a classless society based on common ownership of the means
                of
                production. The manifesto itself is a fascinating read and is many ways more succinct than the holy
                bible,
                in the aspect that only one set of principles are outlined instead of providing conflicting arguments
                for
                each side of issues. The key points in the manifesto include the abolition of private property, the
                centralization of the means of production in the hands of the state, and the establishment of a
                dictatorship
                of the proletariat as a transitional stage towards a stateless, classless society. All of which seems
                like
                an intricate social experiment which has its benefits but also, as history has shown us, its downfalls
                too.
                So now we know the fundamentals of communism, we can now derive the positives which are provided from
                this
                ideology. First of all, the elimination of class inequality could provide a peaceful utopia with the
                state
                distributing the wealth evenly across all inhabitants, regardless of their socioeconomic background.
                Sounds
                good right, until we dive into the complexities of human psychology. Work gives us purpose and the
                possibility of earning more money in order to live more comfortably may benefit us. Capitalism
                personified.
                With state controlled monopolies, communism can quickly evolve into totalitarianism.<br><br>
                To get away from this sinister train of thought. An overwhelmingly positive aspect which I can think of
                is
                communist societies often prioritise providing basic necessities such as healthcare, education, housing,
                and
                employment to all citizens as fundamental rights rather than privileges. In the UK, we already have a
                taste
                of this with the NHS and public school so this would have a much greater effect in America where
                healthcare
                is exhaustionate (from what I’ve heard). By employing this, it can lead to improved living standards and
                reduced poverty rates for the population. Point for communism.<br><br>

            <p class="blog-content">


                I read that when there is no competition among peers, there is an emphasis on cooperation and
                solidarity. So
                with the abolishment of capitalism, the importance of camaraderie among individuals and communities
                rather
                than competition and individualism is inflated. This fosters a sense of community and mutual support,
                which
                can contribute to social unity and well-being. Again reiterating that social utopia what I was talking
                about
                earlier.<br><br>
                Because everything is state run, it means that there is still a government in place to distribute the
                wealth. Even though there may be a president or prime minister, the people have more control in
                governance
                and policy-making. Now, one the one hand, this could lead to increased political participation and
                empowerment of the masses, or it could be detrimental to the countries GDP and services because even
                though
                everyone is equal in this egalitarian society, I’m positive that not everyone will be sufficiently
                educated
                to make the powerful decision which only officials in the upper echelons of government should be
                required to
                make.<br><br>
                Although there are obviously some pitfalls when implementing this system and clearly some wrinkles which
                need to be straightened out, but that doesn’t explain how countries like the USSR, Laos, China and North
                Korea have slipped so far into imperialism that it is difficult to come back from that. Well, many
                communist
                states have faced challenges such as corruption, authoritarianism, economic inefficiency, and human
                rights
                abuses, which have undermined the realisation of these ideals. Also, the feasibility and desirability of
                communist principles remain subjects of debate among scholars and policymakers.
                <br><br> However, it's important to note that the implementation of communist ideology in various
                countries
                throughout history has often deviated from the ideals laid out in the manifesto. Despotic rulers have
                often
                manipulated communist ideology for their own authoritarian purposes, leading to totalitarian regimes and
                widespread human rights abuses.<br><br>
                The Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin, for example, implemented a form of communism known as
                Marxism-Leninism, which deviated significantly from the original principles of Marxism. Similarly,
                countries
                like China under Mao Zedong and North Korea under Kim Il Sung adopted variations of communism that
                veered
                away from Marx's vision.<br><br>
                So, while the core principles of communism as laid out in "The Communist Manifesto" may have noble
                intentions of achieving social equality and justice, the historical record of communist regimes has been
                marred by authoritarianism, repression, and economic inefficiency. This complex history has contributed
                to
                the negative connotations associated with communism in many parts of the world. So to conclude a blog
                post
                in what has been an education for myself, if communism is executed correctly, the principles may work
                and
                benefit all however it is far more likely that an imperious leader will get corrupted with the power
                bestowed on him and stray into his own ideology which benefits him over the people. Succinctly,
                communism is
                bad.
