                In 2016, I was too young to vote on Britain's exit from the European Union. Even if I could vote, I
                didn’t
                understand the potential ramifications of leaving the warm comfort of the EU. How could it affect me, I
                was
                protected by living in my social bubble of Darlington. A town where I had little ambition and a life of
                monotony waiting for me. I procrastinated in getting a real job and dragged my feet in choosing a
                career.
                Even if I did show glimpses of precociousness and watched the news, would I have anticipated that the
                preceding changes would influence my life in any way? Probably not.
                <br><br>
                However, my circumstances have inevitably changed. I have found my vocation which has created goals for
                my
                future. Things which are tangible and I have seen achieved by people close to me. Leaving home was the
                impetus for my new cosmopolitan outlook. University certainly has a reputation of changing people, but I
                fervently believe that it’s the individual circumstances which culminates to change - not geographic
                location. One person can achieve more in ten years than others can in a lifetime. My university
                experience
                has not been centred around drinking and partying analogous to the stereotypes of student life. Don’t
                mistake my focus on personal focus and academic pursuits for pretentiousness; I have friends who have
                followed that path and have proceeded to have a successful career. I merely don’t enjoy being
                intoxicated
                and prefer to be cognizant at all times.
                <br><br>
                One of the many experiences which all respectable universities offer is the perspective of studying
                abroad.
                For me, this was not part of my plan for my time at uni, but my enlightened outlook convinced me to
                seize
                the opportunities when they arrive. I am writing this almost halfway through my second semester of my
                Erasmus year in Stockholm, which means I have already had to navigate my way through all the
                bureaucratic
                nonsense and labyrinth of forms which one has to complete in order to legally live in another country.

                First of all, I am blessed to be a UK citizen therefore I have a strong passport which doesn’t attenuate
                the
                range of countries which I can enter. Upon selecting a destination, many exchange students who I have
                interacted with, have made it clear to me that the strength of one’s passport can greatly dictate the
                range
                of countries they can study in. Despite the added complexity of leaving the EU, this has proved not to
                be an
                issue for me when choosing a host university. The most pertinent documents I needed to complete was a
                visa
                application and a study permit. Every country has their own byzantine and nebulous rules for potential
                students and foreign workers. Sweden is no different. I completed the forms for my study permit,
                however, I
                struggled to ascertain the information regarding how to apply for a visa. To complete my Study Permit
                application, I visited the European Visa office in London to present my passport. Despite the
                superfluous
                reminders via letters and email to go the the visa office, upon arrival - and a forty minute wait - the
                officer informed me I had to get my application ratified at the Swedish embassy. This prolonged my stay
                in
                London as the Swedish embassy was closed on Wednesday because the Swedes follow their own calendar
                regardless of the fact they are based in another country. This meeting was beneficial as I was informed
                that
                the visa application had been filled out in conjunction with the study permit therefore crossing off
                another
                item off my to do list. Brexit grievance number one. If I was still a citizen of a member state, I would
                only need a study permit, thus saving me weeks of research and consternation.
                <br><br>
                Now I had the required documents to get into the country, I was obligated to go to the immigration
                centre in
                the suburbs of Stockholm to get my biometrics scanned and photographed for security reasons. I don’t get
                special dispensation when waiting in these queues because I’m British, therefore, I am spending the
                majority
                of the morning waiting for an appointment which takes less than five minutes. This additional security
                check
                is for the benefit of the Swedish government and not for me. Succinctly, it is just another bureaucratic
                hoop which I needed to jump through. With the security checks completed, I was given a tangible study
                permit
                and a stern warning. I need to carry my permit with me everytime I leave the country, otherwise, I may
                not
                be allowed back.
                <br><br>
                So, the majority of the legwork has been done. I’m in Sweden and it was just a case of trying to survive
                on
                the money I had saved up and the increased student loan which I get from Student Finance England. EU
                students have access to a European initiative called the erasmus scheme. This entitles all recipients to
                a
                sum of money to relieve the financial trepidation about living in a foreign country where the cost of
                living
                may be higher. As a Brit, I do not have access to this, however the British government has created a
                facsimile scheme called the Turing scheme which offers the same financial perks to UK students. It is a
                reduced amount compared with the Erasmus scheme with different stipulations attributing the net amount a
                student gets. Those heading to the US or Canada receive the most whilst students attending a European
                university get less. I have saved a respectable amount therefore this was not causing me a prodigious
                level
                of stress however I will never turn down more grants. The main benefit of the grant being I don’t need
                to
                repay it - unlike a student loan.
                <br><br>
                I had been in Sweden for a few weeks when I was exposed to the fact that there are certain services and
                contracts which I cannot attain. The most problematic being a phone contract. Every Swedish citizen is
                assigned a personnel number. This is similar to a social security number in the UK. Everyone must
                present
                this number when they are purchasing tickets, contracts, healthcare, etc. (This was a persistent problem
                when trying to find suitable accommodation throughout the summer.) As an international student, I am
                assigned a T-number - as in transitory number. This is supposed to function as the equivalent of a
                personnel
                number for any individual who is residing in Sweden for a short duration. This allows us to purchase
                cars,
                contracts, pay rent payments - at least that is the intended theory. In reality, this is not the case.
                Venders such as mobile phone sim providers do not accept these t-numbers leaving us in a tricky
                position. In
                my case, I circumvented the issue by not using internet on my phone at all during my stay in Sweden
                because
                the pay-as-you-go sim cards were very expensive and offered egregious tariffs on data.
                <br><br>
                To conclude a prolonged blog post, the positives of doing a year in a foreign country far outweigh the
                headaches of trying to get there in the first place. The systems in place may be archaic and the
                practices
                may be esoteric to all except those who implement them, but persevering is all part of the experience.
                Think
                of it as the first step on a long odyssey. There will be plenty more moments throughout the year that
                will
                cause severe distress, like forgetting your study permit or losing your house key. It is all part of the
                experience to be versatile and see you navigate these situations. The worst thing that you can do is
                panic
                because that doesn’t help anyone. Think logically and always ask for help if you feel stuck. Every
                university will have Eramus officers willing to guide you when you feel lost and are always there to
                offer
                advice when you think times get tough.
