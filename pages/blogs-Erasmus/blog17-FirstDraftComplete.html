                So you may remember, I said that I would start writing a book after I enjoyed writing my short story so
                much. If you don’t you can find that blog
                <a href="http://localhost/phpProjects/www.narrative/pages/blogs-Erasmus/blog9-SoImWritingABook.php"
                   id="blog-link">here</a>.
                But to summarise, I opted to start writing without a conclusion or even the vestiges of a plot.
                Regardless, I wrote and wrote and wrote and eventually, a storyline emerged. To offer some logistics
                into the scope of this venture. The first draft is around 50,000 words and currently has twenty
                chapters. From my research, I need to surpass a minimum of 60,000 for a story to qualify as an official
                novel and not a novella or short story therefore in future drafts I will be developing the story further
                and adding sub-plots and characters.
                <br><br>
                Now for the story. Maybe because I had read Russel T Davies book and binged a lot of his shows when I
                started writing, I have written a story about an introvert who moves to Cardiff and then falls in love
                with a boy and eventually comes out to his parents. That is the stripped-back, oversimplified plot of
                the story. I find it a little disconcerting how influenced I was by Russell T Davies given that I have
                written an LGBT story, a genre which I have little interest in until now. I’ve set it in Cardiff, the
                birthplace of the rebooted Doctor Who series. Even called the main characters Jack and Charlie, two
                names which are recurring in Russell’s tv shows.
                <br><br>
                If we look past the influencing factors, I do honestly believe that this story is crap. Not what you
                were expecting me to say, huh. Well, first drafts always are. There’s no point denying it. My personal
                dislikes include the huge chunks of exposition and the shallow characters. I find some scenes to be a
                little too fairytale. Fleshing out characters is still something which I am working on and eventually
                I’ll get there. The storyline which I’ve fallen down is currently very two-dimensional because I haven’t
                made a plan but I have a few ideas about elements which I can develop which adds intrigue into the plot.
                <br><br>
                This takes me nicely onto my next point of showing not telling. Personally, I was always taught in every
                subject which requires writing, write your answers like you are talking to an idiot. This is good advice
                for essay questions but it is a different ball park when writing a story. It’s this type of spelling out
                plot points which I find deplorable. Treating the audience as idiots leads to large parts of the story
                being boring or even perhaps cringey because the reader doesn’t need to think for themselves. To give
                examples in Doctor Who, Steven Moffat’s tenure as showrunner included many episodes which were very
                intellectual and we, the viewers, needed more to understand every part of the story. Chibnall’s tenure
                was the opposite, narrowing the show’s demographic, inexplicably into a children’s show with every story
                spelled out with vast scenes of dialogue and exposition. Russel’s was probably the best balance for the
                show but there were still plenty of episodes in which potent details remained sequestered. If I can
                choose I would opt for Moffat’s side of the spectrum but I fear I have gravitated towards Chibnall’s
                style.
                <br><br>
                In the second draft, along with adding subplots to add more depth, I need to limit the use of certain
                words. To describe what a character is feeling or experiencing, I tend to explain facial expressions and
                try to portray the character’s demeanour using the same limited vocabulary. This goes back to treating
                the audience like morons and I need to stop doing that. I need to find the proportion between letting
                the reader discern the characters emotions for themselves and not adding enough detail, making the
                reader feel lost or disinterested.
                <br><br>
                I think this is a good place to start. Even though the first draft is complete, the second will have
                another 30,000 words appended to it and also more characters and plots interwoven into it. This draft
                took me around a month but the second revision should take much longer if I do it right.
