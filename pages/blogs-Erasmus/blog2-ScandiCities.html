                The three salient cities in Scandinavia include Oslo, Copenhagen and Stockholm. I currently live in
                Stockholm therefore I have a partisan opinion towards my home from home, however I will do my best to
                give
                my opinions in a quasi-objective manner regarding which is the best city. First and foremost, I know
                that
                there are four nordic capitals but I have not visited Helsinki, therefore I think it would be premature
                for
                me to add it to my review. The three capitals I have visited are all beautiful in their own right. They
                have
                innate value which gives them uniqueness making them distinguishable and memorable. They are analogous
                in
                certain respects as each country shares characteristics and viking culture. As an Englishman, I am
                fortunate
                that most countries have English as a second language and in Scandinavia, this is no different. English
                translations are available in coffee shops and museums, making travel easier for English speakers.
                Certain
                architectural similarities include historic buildings and one will notice that none have prodigious
                tourist
                attractions moulding the skyline. All Scandinavian buildings are congruous because the foundations
                cannot
                withstand the skyscrapers which cast a shadow over other notable European cities. According to the local
                guides, the buildings would sink in an ephemeral few decades. There are other similarities however the
                raison d’etre of this blog is to establish which is my favourite, therefore, I will start with Stockholm
                as
                that is my current residence for my Erasmus year.

                <strong>Stockholm</strong>
                <br><br>
                When it came to choosing universities for my Erasmus year, my options were limited to Stockholm and
                Malmo,
                due to course restrictions. I always prefer to choose capital cities whenever possible, so that's how I
                ended up in Stockholm. Contrary to my expectations, Stockholm is smaller than I anticipated, occupying a
                paltry 188km2. This feels smaller still when standing in the fulcrum of the city.The small capital is
                divided into districts by numerous rivers and canals flowing through the centre. All the water flows
                directly to the Baltic Sea, making navigation relatively easy. The Royal Palace is situated in Gamla
                Stan,
                the island which neatly separates the north from the south part of the city. Known as the old town, this
                area is a tourist hotspot, but unfortunately, much of the revered architecture has been repurposed into
                tacky tourist shops. In an effort not to denigrate Stockholm, this is the status quo in most cities
                where
                the most populated areas are. Many cosmopolitan neighbourhoods encompass the periphery of the city, with
                the
                metro conveniently offering quick access to each. <br><br> Stockholm university campuses are placed
                sporadically
                throughout these neighbourhoods with the main Frescati campus a ten minute metro journey from the
                central
                station. The campus buildings are decorous with the environs, repurposing the original 18th century
                facades.
                Frescati campus is actually located in a national park making it a tranquil and vibrant centre for
                students.
                Public transport is a cheap and intuitive system for locals and tourists alike. One ticket is valid for
                seventy five minutes and covers all modes of transport - even the ferries. As I am an ersatz native, I
                have
                invested in the equivalent of a London Oyster card which grants me access to all modes of transport at
                any
                time for the duration of the year. During the warmer season, I have a penchant for taking long walks
                down
                the promenade and reading my book whilst overlooking the precipice of Sodermalm - the southern part of
                Stockholm. Comparatively during the winter months, I can do the same odyssey and watch the ice skaters
                and
                skiers take advantage of the frozen Baltic sea. My personal thoughts after living here for six months
                are
                mostly positive. By personal preference, I would have chosen a voluminous city with a livelier
                environment.
                Stockholm is shroud in history making it an idyllic place to live, however being a small city with less
                than
                a million inhabitants, makes it a monolithic environment where industry is dwindling and there aren't
                many
                opportunities. On this communiqué alone, I would not like to emigrate to Sweden permanently however that
                doesn’t tacitly imply that I won’t enjoy the remainder of my Erasmus year here.

                <strong>Copenhagen</strong>
                <br><br>
                Shifting our focus to the Danish capital. I spent a brief few days in Copenhagen at the beginning of
                winter.
                I agree that my stay wasn't long enough to offer a comprehensive review of the city's culture and
                attractions. However, I can share my initial impressions of its vibrancy and gregarious nature. Despite
                the
                winter shill, I covered an extensive area of the city. I started in the town centre which was bustling
                with
                tourists and headed towards the resplendent lights of Nyhavn. This is the most populated part of the
                city
                and attracts all the tourists because of the multi-coloured facades and the plethora of restaurants and
                cafes in the vicinity. The Christmas markets were in full swing during my visit. Compared to the markets
                in
                Stockholm, they were somewhat dull, but I still enjoyed visiting them with cheerful enthusiasm. As with
                any
                seasonal markets, the prices do not correlate with the rest of the city. A burger would normally cost
                approximately, the equivalent of £5, however because this is a christmas market, the prices are inflated
                leaving tourists to defray hugely. <br><br>
                While I'm sure this is not unique to Copenhagen, the Christmas
                markets were a prominent feature of my visit in late November. To take a respite from the inclement
                weather, I
                visited some of Copenhagen’s venerated museums and galleries. First, the national art gallery, located a
                short walk from the centre through a national park. I would fall under the category of neophyte
                dilettante
                when it comes to art. I enjoy art through the medium of photography and can appreciate paintings from
                the
                pre-twentieth century however, the national gallery held many modern contemporary exhibitions which,
                regretfully, I didn’t understand. I’ll let you draw your own inference from a couple of the displays
                below.
                I pride myself on being liberal minded and receptive, but this exhibition didn’t resonate with me. I
                moved
                on to more traditional art which resided in the Museet of Kopenhagen. This took me on a journey from the
                16th century epoch, hitherto the dissolution of the Danish Empire. I learnt a great deal and would
                highly
                recommend it to anyone. Taking an objective stance, the city is cosmopolitan with a liberal mindset. It
                has
                been voted one of the safest cities in the world for the LGBT community; also one of the first cities to
                legalise gay marriage. The cosmopolitan nature shines through, and the cordial locals are some of the
                most
                amiable people I have ever met. My only advice for tourists is to watch out for cyclists!

                <strong>Oslo</strong>
                <br><br>
                Oslo is a city whose reputation precedes it. Despite its expansive size, Oslo exudes a sense of intimacy
                and
                local charm. While it feels like the smallest capital city I've visited, this perception belies Oslo’s
                true
                size. This is because all the tourist attractions, museums, palaces, and parks are within a
                fifteen-minute
                vicinity of each other. This proximity is ideal for tourists who want to see as much as possible in a
                short
                amount of time. The coastal walk along the Baltic Sea begins at the Opera House and takes you through
                town
                halls, the Nobel Peace Museum, the National Museum, and the disused military base. The city boasts a
                bustling metropolis with a cosmopolitan flair. Oslo’s reverential reputation is what attracts such an
                eclectic population. It is widely regarded as a safe and beautiful city which represents the best of
                scandinavia. During my visit, the Baltic Sea was frozen over, allowing locals to walk from one promenade
                to
                another via the shortcut over the ice. Many were enjoying ice skating and skiing. Along the shoreline
                where
                the ice had been broken, locals were jumping into the sea, which is believed to have many medical
                benefits
                for blood flow. However, in minus five degrees, this activity didn't appeal to me. The various boats
                lined
                the harbour but it wasn’t until attending a walking tour that I was told that they were actually saunas
                on
                the water, as this is part of the ritual after jumping in the freezing sea. <br><br>My opinion of the
                city
                holistically is of overwhelming sanguine regard. Even when I travelled out to the suburbs and the
                sequestered parks, the idyllic landscape was beautiful and clean. Now, onto the only flaw of the city.
                Cost.
                One has to prepare for a 100% increase on prices when in the centre of the city. My first meal in the
                city
                was at a sports bar in central station after travelling for ninety minutes on the plane and the train.
                This
                sports bar was part of a chain which I had eaten at in Stockholm which is what led me to believe that it
                would be reasonable however this was not the case. The burger cost more than double than its counterpart
                in
                Sweden and this was a stark introduction of the price range which the local delicacies were. Restaurants
                out
                in the suburbs still maintained the inflated prices leading me to believe that this is just the status
                quo
                in Oslo. Nevertheless, this makes it one of the most expensive cities I have visited. (Copenhagen is a
                close
                second). Despite its hefty price tag, Oslo is a modern city with beautiful architecture exemplified by
                the
                grand Opera House and town halls. On a sunny day, because of its design, tourists can walk up the sloped
                roof of the Opera house to get an unhindered view over the centre of Oslo. Similar to the other
                Scandinavian
                capitals, there are no skyscrapers which interrupt the equilibrium of the city keeping it slick and
                open. My
                reflection is congruent to my experience in Oslo however I would like to return in the summer when I can
                walk around freely without being stymied by the icey hills and the snowy walkways.

                In conclusion, each of the Scandinavian capitals - Stockholm, Copenhagen, and Oslo - offers a unique
                blend
                of culture, history, and charm, making them all worthy contenders for anyone seeking to explore the
                region.
                While each city has its own distinct character and attractions, they share common threads of safety,
                cleanliness, and a liberal mindset that make them appealing to visitors from around the world.
                Stockholm, with its historic Gamla Stan and picturesque waterways, offers a blend of tranquillity and
                vibrancy, though its smaller size may limit opportunities for some. Copenhagen, on the other hand,
                impresses
                with its lively atmosphere, colourful architecture, and cultural offerings, despite the higher prices in
                certain areas. Oslo stands out for its intimate feel, proximity of attractions, and stunning natural
                surroundings, albeit with a steep cost of living.
                <br><br>
                Ultimately, the choice of which city reigns supreme comes down to personal preferences and priorities.
                Whether one seeks the cosmopolitan buzz of Copenhagen, the historic charm of Stockholm, or the intimate
                allure of Oslo, each city promises a memorable experience and a glimpse into the best of Scandinavian
                living.
