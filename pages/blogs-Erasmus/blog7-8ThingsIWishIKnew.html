            <p class="blog-content">
                I am currently living in Stockholm as part of an exchange program provided by my home university in the
                UK.
                I attended all the briefings and did sufficient due diligence when the time came to find accommodation
                in
                Sweden. After being here for four months, I have realised three are a few things I would do differently
                if I
                had the choice.
                <br><br>
                <strong>1. Get your priorities right when choosing a city</strong>
                <br><br>
                I chose Stockholm because of the modules which were on offer. My home university lacked diversity when
                building the Computer Science syllabus in order for each module to be inter-connected. University of
                Stockholm does bother with building a linear course structure which develops previously taught concepts.
                This allowed me to choose any modules from Search Engine Optimisation to Knowledge Management
                techniques.
                Now that I have almost finished my first semester, I realise the course should not have been the
                overwhelming reason to pick Stockholm. This year is not about studying. It’s about exploring, meeting
                new
                people, trying new food, learning new languages and understanding new cultures. Don’t interpret my
                personal
                reflection as regret. I am pleased with my choice to come to Stockholm however my time is predominantly
                focused on studying rather than exploring. Also as an erasmus student my year is graded on a pass/fail
                basis
                so I wouldn’t get the recognition for an A* anyway.
                <br><br>
                <strong>2. Cash is NOT king anymore</strong>
                <br><br>
                “Always get some local currency, Harry. It’ll always be useful Harry.” Despite Stockholm being an
                historic
                city with architecture over 500 years old, it has moved very fast with the current trends. With the
                impetus
                of the pandemic, very few establishments accept cash payments. Even the large highstreet stores such as
                H&M
                and Jack & Jones outright refuse to accept cash. So now I am stuck with over £250 in Swedish Krona which
                is
                being refused even by the Belgium waffle stands and the street performers. What makes my lack of
                foresight
                even more egregious: I haven’t even used English currency since 2015. Apple Pay is King now. Moral of
                the
                story: Don’t listen to your father when he’s giving you esoteric facts about a country he’s never
                visited.
                <br><br>
                <strong>3. Do what you enjoy</strong>
                <br><br>
                It is unlikely that you are going to get this opportunity again so this is the perfect opportunity to
                reinvent who you are. Ever felt like trying something new back home but you thought you would feel out
                of
                place or even be judged for doing it. Now is the time to follow your passion. Try everything once. In my
                case nobody knows me in Sweden and therefore no one has any preconceived perceptions of me. (Apart from
                the
                stereotypical English persona that we all drink tea, have a posh accent and sing God save the King every
                morning). I tapped into my childhood climbing skills at Bouldering, became cognizant of all the wars and
                monarchs whilst participating in walking tours and regained my equilibrium with yoga at the university
                sports centre. Ok so they didn’t become a weekly pastime , but I experienced them and they were
                activities
                which I wouldn’t have done in the UK.
                <br><br>
                <strong>4. Get used to social faux pas’</strong>
                <br><br>
                You’re in a new country in a new city. It’s inevitable that you’re going to make mistakes but don’t let
                that
                dissuade you from doing things. Sweden is in Europe so the customs are very similar to that which I am
                used
                to in the UK. It’s the little things like using the wrong phrases or looking the wrong way when crossing
                the
                road. (That one was more stupid that anything else). I don’t mind making this errors nor do I find it
                embarrassing because I am after all foreign so it is almost expected of me to stumble whilst finding my
                feet
                here. Following the crowd will only take you so far, therefore you need to find your own journey to get
                the
                most out of your time abroad.

                <strong>5. Don’t get stressed</strong>
                <br><br>
                Although many would agree that getting the paperwork sorted so you can legally live in another country
                can
                be stressful if you don’t have the forms necessary. I suppose I am fortunate in the fact that I come
                from a
                country which has easier procedures in place and less scrupulous checks when it comes to immigrating.
                There
                were moments of uncertainty such as how do I apply for a Visa? Is the study permit included in the Visa?
                How
                do I get on a waiting list for university accommodation?
                <br><br>
                It's important to note that the answers to these questions vary depending on the destination country,
                and
                sometimes, they might be in the native language. In such situations, tools like Google Translate become
                invaluable. Instead of seeing these challenges as obstacles, consider them integral parts of the
                exchange
                experience. They are the hurdles you must overcome before stepping onto foreign soil, marking the
                beginning
                of your journey.
                <br><br>
                It's crucial to manage stress during this process. Getting bogged down by minor details can increase the
                likelihood of homesickness, detracting from the true essence of your year abroad. Embrace these
                challenges
                as part of the adventure and keep in mind that overcoming them is an integral part of your
                transformative
                experience abroad.
                <br><br>
                <strong>6. Learn to enjoy your own company</strong>
                <br><br>
                Being the sole representative from my home university in Stockholm didn't initially bother me, as the
                fellow
                students embarking on an Erasmus year were all strangers to me. However, upon arriving in Sweden and
                engaging in fresher events and joining societies, I anticipated encountering at least one other English
                person. To my surprise, that wasn't the case. Comfortable with my own company and inherently
                introverted, I
                did make a conscious effort to socialise more during my time abroad.
                Navigating social situations proved challenging at times. There were instances when, in a group
                exploring
                together, everyone would start conversing in their shared language, leaving me as the lone English
                speaker.
                For example, during my second week here, I visited the national museum with a group of students from my
                accommodation—half Spanish, half Dutch. For the remainder of the day, English became a rarity unless I
                specifically posed a question.
                <br><br>
                Fortunately, this didn't weigh heavily on me, as I'm content with pursuing my interests independently.
                My
                advice is not to be disheartened by these experiences. People naturally gravitate toward those with
                similar
                backgrounds and relatable experiences. Embrace your individual journey, and don't let moments of
                solitude
                overshadow the broader, enriching experience of studying abroad.
                <br><br>
                <strong>7. Do you own research instead of relying on teachers and international coordinators</strong>
                <br><br>
                When I say do your own research, I mean research everything from location of the University, distance to
                campus, nearest grocery store, public transport links, student reviews on accommodation and the course.
                These are all things which should get you excited for your time abroad and give you the briefest
                insights
                into what living in that country is like. I made the mistake of thinking that I would be studying in the
                main campus in the north of Stockholm … Wrong. I am actually located in the suburb of Kista which is
                north
                west and a 45 minute metro ride from the main campus. By the time I figured this out, I was already
                committed to Stockholm.
                <br><br>
                In your exploration, go beyond the essentials and look into what makes the city unique. Be aware that
                some
                cities aren’t as LGBT+ friendly as others. Understand that cultural norms may differ, such as the use of
                whitening beauty products in some Asian countries, which may be perceived differently in the UK. Strive
                for
                comfort in your chosen country while respecting cultural differences—even if you don't necessarily agree
                with them. Embracing diverse perspectives is integral to personal growth and learning.
                <br><br>
                <strong>8. Creature Comforts</strong>
                <br><br>
                Keep doing the things which you enjoy. Join local sports teams, local gyms or societies. Be active, read
                your favourite book series and watch the next season of trashy reality shows. Throughout all this
                adventure,
                you will want to visit home. This doesn’t mean that you will be home sick but this feeling of loneliness
                can
                be assuaged by partaking in an activity which was a regular routine at home. Personally, I maintaked my
                connection to home by rewatching Doctor Who episodes and reading books. Not everyday needs to be a new
                adventure. Some days can be days for recuperation and rest. Having a language barrier or a tough commute
                to
                university can be challenging so it is vitally important to recognise if you are getting burnt out. A
                facetime with friends or family can be a great confidence booster because they will incessantly mention
                how
                brave you are for undertaking this journey.
                <br><br>
                In conclusion, my Erasmus year so far has been a transformative journey filled with valuable lessons.
                Choosing a city based solely on the academic offerings may not guarantee a fulfilling experience, as the
                essence of this year lies in exploration and personal growth. While cash may have been king in the past,
                adapting to current trends, like the prevalence of digital payment methods, is essential for smooth
                living
                abroad. Embracing new activities and not being afraid of social faux pas contribute to a richer
                experience,
                reminding us that it's the journey, not just the destination, that matters.
                <br><br>
                Navigating bureaucratic hurdles can be stressful, but viewing them as integral parts of the exchange
                adventure helps maintain a positive perspective. Enjoying your own company and finding comfort in
                familiar
                activities are crucial for maintaining balance amid cultural differences and potential moments of
                solitude.
                <br><br>
                Lastly, conducting thorough research on your destination, beyond the basics, is vital to avoid surprises
                and
                ensure a smoother transition. So, as you embark on your own Erasmus adventure, remember to keep an open
                mind, cherish every experience, and savour the unique blend of challenges and rewards that come with
                studying abroad.
