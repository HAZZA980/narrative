                After my visit to Austria, I have now seen prestigious art collections in Stockholm, Copenhagen, Gdansk,
                Oslo, London and Vienna. Each has a particular style and cannot be compared as they all have their own
                identity. The pieces in the National Gallery in London included very moving pieces from the renaissance
                epoch which accentuates the suffering and pain felt by displaced artists. Also venerated work from Van
                Goch
                and Monet also added gravitas to the collection.
                <br><br>
                The galleries in Stockholm and Copenhagen both featured on the esoteric aspects of their respective
                histories. The National Gallery in Copenhagen takes us on a journey from the height of Danish power with
                paintings signifying the opulence and caprice of Danish society to the renaissance works following the
                wars
                for independence by the previously subjugated countries. The character of the collection was almost
                palpable
                as there was a conspicuous shift from pre-war to post-war artists.
                <br><br>
                The National Museet of Stockholm was analogous to the collection in Copenhagen as it was subjugated for
                many
                centuries by the Danish empire though the gallery concentrated on the post-independence epoch of art.
                Their
                vast collection celebrated the freedom of the Swedish people and could be described as more eccentric
                and
                eclectic than the Danes.

                I have already stated my reverence and appreciation for the culture in Vienna in other blogs however I
                don’t
                think it is superfluous to reiterate the prodigious impact which has led the Austrian culture to
                proliferate
                across Europe. The Albertino Gallery proudly showcased the works of Mozart and Pablo Picasso during my
                visits which added to the myriad of artists who shaped Austrian society.
                <br><br>
                I fervently believe that if the art is powerful enough, it should be able to inculcate a range of
                emotions
                onto the viewer. Almost every gallery I’ve been to reduces this allure by expatiating how the Artist
                wants
                us to feel. I would prefer a detailed account of the history of the painting and the contemporary
                society in
                which it was created. Not a quasi-objective guide on what the art represents. To add another layer of
                ersatz
                gravitas, the descriptions use words such as melancholy, ethereal and resplendent in order to increase
                the
                grandeur. I find these descriptions pretentious and ruin the arcane nature of art. French Impressionist
                painter and sculptor Edgar Degas is credited with saying “"Art is not what you see, but what you make
                others
                see". This is the paragon of what all Art is and should be.
                <br><br>
                I have found spontaneous art exhibitions have correctly captured the essence of art as they allow the
                audience to make their own inferences about the creations. Art will always be subjective and we can
                never
                know unequivocally the mindset of revered artisans such as Van Goch, Pollock and Schiele. Their personal
                afflictions inspired beauty and produced masterpieces which in turn inspires others. This tacit
                knowledge
                cannot be communicated through the use of literary word. The un-objectiveness of art allows everyone to
                interpret the same work in a plethora of ways.
