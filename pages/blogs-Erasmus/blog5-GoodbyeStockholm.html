                The year is over and my suitcase is packed. A year on Erasmus completed and one final year to complete
                till
                I get my well deserved degree. There were no tears nor any other pitiful displays of emotion. I am not
                one
                of those people that experience emotional attachment to locations or other inanimate objects.
                Sentimentality
                is reserved for those who deeply experience empathy. As much as Stockholm has given me countless amazing
                memories, it’s time to leave and move on to the next chapter.
                <br><br>
                As mentioned, I have one final year of my degree left which I will complete in Leicester. Do I feel like
                the
                courses I took at Stockholm University will aid me in my dissertation projects? Probably not. The three
                year
                course is constructed so the technologies used in the final year is a culmination of all the modules and
                skills we have accumulated in the previous two years. However, I wouldn’t infer that the additional
                modules
                are therefore irrelevant - just superfluous. Some were good consolitary subjects such as the Network
                Security and Cyber Security as I had previously completed similar curriculums at De Montfort in my
                second
                year. The other courses were either chosen out of interest or curiosity. Search Engine Optimisation was
                a
                personal highlight for me as it was an area of Web Development which I remained ignorant of until
                completing
                the course on Exchange.
                <br><br>
                In addition to my academic responsibilities, primarily, I was in Stockholm to experience the culture and
                explore the beautiful city. My expectations beforehand were reserved. It was my first time leaving my
                home
                country in half a decade so I really only had the opinion of others spurring me on. Stockholm is a
                capital
                city, the heart of Swedish culture. The citadel of the arts, music and tradition. An impressive resume
                despite its meagre size in comparison to its Scandinavian rivals. An incredibly old city which has been
                modernised to keep its relevance in the tumultuous age of technology. Subtle additions which keep the
                archaic setting whilst making it accessible and new.
                <br><br>
                The city itself is actually a collection of islands which have been connected with bridges and buildings
                to
                make it cohesive. The rivers flowing in parallel throughout all lead to the fulcrum of Stockholm which
                is
                Gamla Stan. An island directly in the centre which separates the north and the south territories.
                Locally
                called the Old Town, this island is the tourist hotspot which is not littered with tat shops and
                restaurants. As much as I would prefer to have this parade of consumerism on either of the other islands
                which make up Stockholm, it is understandable why it is located where it is as Gamla Stan also has the
                Royal
                Palace and Parliament building all in the same one kilometre vicinity. Ignoring my personal
                pontifications,
                I have thoroughly enjoyed walking through these streets during the summer sun and the winter snow.

                Now, indulge me as I release my true British persona and start complaining about the weather. The
                freezing
                winter cannot be ignored in a summary review of my time in Sweden. Given that it started snowing in mid
                November and didn’t stop until the end of March. The warnings I was given about mother nature’s cruel
                winters were naively ignored until I arrived in Stockholm. I didn’t factor in the enormous impact which
                the
                weather would have on my Erasmus year as I live in the UK where it always rains. In hindsight, I am
                cognizant enough to admit that I was vastly underprepared. At times it could be depressing watching dusk
                fall in the early-afternoon and having to wear five layers of clothing just to do the weekly shop, but I
                learnt to look for the positives in this situation. (Admittedly, by January, I had spent the Christmas
                break
                at home and acclimated to the UK weather again. Cold but not cold enough for my extremities to go numb.
                Therefore, instead of spending the start of 2024 suffering in the Swedish winter, I took this
                opportunity to
                visit the surrounding countries - Copenhagen, Vienna, Amsterdam, Prague, Oslo, Gdansk. I simply couldn’t
                bear the minus twenty ice age for a further two months.
                <br><br>
                Alternatively, there are always silver linings in even the most lamentable circumstances. With darkness
                encompassing the city, the Northern Lights were clearly visible on numerous occasions even in the
                confines
                of the city lights. I am just a passing traveller experiencing the Scandinavian winter but the locals
                are
                stoic and unphased by the weather. The nightlight is bustling with hipster speakeasies and poetry
                recitals
                and gallery exhibitions. This was the clearest dichotomy between my native UK and Sweden. This is where
                the
                Swedes excel and the British are too accustomed to their ways in fulfilling asinine stereotypes. The
                culture
                and mirth which I experienced in these establishments was the pinnacle of my entire year and it was
                something which I stumbled across serendipitously one evening walking through Sodermalm. Watching
                artists
                and artisans display their passions and talents was inspiring and also enviable.
                <br><br>
                This is what the year was all about. Not just the university and the city. They are just bricks,
                buildings,
                and mortar. It’s the people and the experiences which are what makes everything memorable. The
                relationships
                which I made with other Erasmus students and poets and writers. I am studying Computer Science in
                Leicester
                and yet, in Stockholm I managed to write the first 50,000 words of a manuscript for a book. Why, because
                I
                was inspired and that is the most valuable asset I can leave Sweden with. So as my time here is up, and
                I
                will move on to new destinations and embark on new journeys, Stockholm will always have a part of me and
                I
                will see that part of Stockholm in me everytime I start writing, knowing that it all started in this
                quaint
                little city in the heart of Scandinavia.
