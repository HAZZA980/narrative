                Today marked the introduction day for all students at Frescati campus. The festivities were slated to
                begin at 1pm, compelling me to scarf down a burger around 11:30am to ensure I had the energy for the day
                ahead. Upon arrival, I was struck by the lack of any formal welcome. No speeches, no tents—just a large
                group of students milling around a field in what seemed like organized chaos.
                <br><br>
                Despite the initial confusion, I was determined to make the most of the day. I spent the first fifteen
                minutes wandering the vicinity, trying to make sense of the haphazard arrangement. Eventually, I decided
                to join one of the hourly guided tours, hoping to find some fellow English speakers amidst the crowd. It
                was here that I met Karen, another solitary soul navigating the complexities of starting anew in
                Stockholm. We quickly bonded over our shared situation and decided to stick together to stave off the
                feeling of isolation.
                <br><br>
                Our first adventure together was the "speed friending" session. In theory, it was designed to facilitate
                quick, two-minute conversations with different people. In practice, however, it was poorly organized,
                and we often found ourselves stationary for ten minutes at a time. Despite the hiccups, I managed to
                speak to six people in about 25 minutes. After a while, Karen and I decided to abandon the speed
                friending in favor of another guided tour.
                <br><br>
                The tour itself was enlightening, though it left me craving more detailed information about essential
                facilities like the library and the sports center. Following the tour, we ventured into a building
                housing the student unions. There were a few language cafes and sports clubs, but considering the vast
                number of students at Stockholm University, the offerings seemed surprisingly sparse.
                <br><br>
                Overall, the university's efforts at making us feel welcome were underwhelming. Apart from the speed
                friending and the tours, there wasn't much to engage with, which left me slightly disappointed. However,
                I wasn’t ready to give up on the day just yet. While on another impromptu campus tour, I ran into a girl
                I had met during the speed friending session. She introduced me to the only other English person on
                campus that she knew of.
                <br><br>
                We quickly formed a small group, which included an Irish girl and a few Germans. There was an instant
                connection, sharing similar cultural backgrounds and growing up in similar environments. This
                camaraderie led us to the student pub, where we spent a couple of hours chatting and getting to know
                each other better. After the pub, we headed into Stockholm city center to grab some food and shop for a
                jumper, a necessity given the Swedish weather.
                <br><br>
                As the day came to a close, we parted ways with promises to stay in touch via Instagram. Whether these
                fledgling friendships will develop into something more remains to be seen, but for now, I feel a little
                less like a stranger in this city. The welcome festivities may not have lived up to my expectations, but
                the connections I made and the shared experiences with my new acquaintances made it a memorable day
                nonetheless.
