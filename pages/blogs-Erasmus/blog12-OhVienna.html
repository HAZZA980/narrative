                One of the main things I wanted to do when I chose to do an Erasmus year was travel. Always to a new
                country and always to a new city. Vienna was my latest excursion fabled as the root of European culture.
                I had no preconceived knowledge about what the city would be like except for what I had seen in movies;
                however I think The Sound of Music is a little archaic for me to draw comparisons. It would be a new
                experience which is all I was hoping for.
                <br><br>
                Before I go into detail of my visit, I think it’s important to elaborate on why I picked Vienna in
                Austria as opposed to other cities such as Budapest or Berlin. The succinct answer is, Vienna has a
                certain reverence to it which appealed more to me than anywhere else. It is composed of artists and
                artisans but not in a pretentious way as one might expect. Its rich pedigree defined by art, opera,
                music, and poetry has rightfully bestowed veneration and gravitas on the capital city for decades. A
                culture which the city is earnest to share and celebrate. Many classic movies used Vienna as a backdrop,
                partly because of its idyllic beauty but also because of the symbolism which is represented first by its
                coerced involvement in the war and then its freedom and independence. Many great stories have been
                contrived from these themes such as; Letter from an Unknown Woman, The Third Man and of course The Sound
                of Music. If I could assimilate just a paltry amount of this culture to become a more holistic person
                then I would be pleased.
                <br><br>
                I never arrive in a city with a meticulously researched itinerary of landmarks to visit therefore I rely
                on the tour guides from walking tours and use their recommendations on activities for my stay. The
                content of the tours vary from city to city however the general precedent normally includes a
                comprehensive history of the city including pertinent wars and revolutions and notable events in
                between. Each tour is specifically tailored to focus on the city’s greatest asset. In Vienna, we passed
                Mozart’s residence, palaces, museums, churches and also ballet and opera houses as well. As the weather
                stayed fair, I was prolific in the amount of photos I took on my camera. Everything from the President’s
                Palace to monochrome side streets which gave the picture heightened focus on the shapes and shadows.
                Photography is a nascent hobby of mine and it would be extremely hubris of me to comment on the quality
                of the photos so I will let you draw your own inference.

                After the tour, I had a better understanding of the city and also some places which would be ideal to
                see; from public parks, museums to canals which would provide a creative backdrop for a photo. I snapped
                superfluously, not wanting to miss anything. The inclement weather was making it more difficult to hold
                my camera for long durations; therefore, I would dip into the cordial cafes to warm up and taste the
                local delicacies. There are over 900 cafes in the centre of Vienna; a district which is a meagre one
                kilometre squared. Each more grandiose than the last. One can gauge the popularity of a coffee shop by
                observing the lines of enthusiastic customers outside the door.
                <br><br>
                With art at the fulcrum of Viennese culture, it implied that everyone should witness it first hand. With
                a plethora of Galleries on offer, I had to prioritise as I had an iota of time and so many attractions I
                wanted to visit. I opted for the eminent Albertina Gallery which is located in the vicinity of the Royal
                Opera House and Hofburg Palace (the President’s residence). With a reasonable admission fee, I walked
                the halls admiring the works of Picasso, and Monet, along with other contemporary 19th and 20th century
                artists. I have fervent admiration for Picasso’s abstraction pieces because their non-conformity is what
                made his work so salient and yet it offers a vaguely familiar anachronism incongruous to the era.
                Monet’s exquisite use of colour is what separates his many analogous paintings and gives them their own
                identity and story. The brush strokes on the canvas are accentuated by the gallery’s incandescent bulbs
                which make the pictures more vibrant adding to the serenity of the scenes. Having sated my artistic
                appetite, I hastened to a nearby park to take more photos while daylight persisted.
                <br><br>
                Before my arrival into Vienna, I only had one thing which I wanted to see. The Vienna State Opera House.
                I would have been fully satisfied with a tour as all momentous landmarks such as cathedrals and palaces
                offer tours. As dusk fell and I was journeying the streets of the capital, my inexorable inclination to
                see the opera took centre stage - pun intended. Despite the impromptu nature of my trip, I acquired
                tickets to see Carmen. An opera which I had heard of but never researched in detail as to know its
                story. The opera house was as ethereal as I would have expected. The prodigious edifice immediately
                catches one's eye as we pass through the golden arch to enter the heart of the theatre. I felt euphoric
                sitting in that opera house, witnessing such a venerated opera such as Carmen. Ironically, a production
                set in Spain, performed in French in a country which speaks German. But that is inconsequential because
                the opera focuses on portraying emotions through dance and expression. One can understand the beauty of
                it simply by immersing themselves in the grandeur of this magnificent spectacle.

                In conclusion, Vienna proved to be a captivating journey into the heart of European culture. My decision
                to embark on this Erasmus year adventure was driven by a desire to explore new horizons and immerse
                myself in the rich tapestry of this historic city. Vienna's artistic heritage, from the grandeur of its
                opera houses to the masterpieces adorning its galleries, left an indelible mark on my soul. I wandered
                its streets, capturing moments of beauty with my camera and savouring local delicacies in its charming
                cafes.
                <br><br>
                While this brief excursion offered only a glimpse into Vienna's cultural wealth, it ignited a passion
                within me to delve deeper into its history, art, and traditions. The Vienna State Opera House, with its
                ethereal aura, allowed me to experience the magic of Carmen, transcending language barriers and
                resonating with the universal language of emotions. As I departed Vienna, I couldn't help but feel a
                sense of longing to return and explore its treasures more comprehensively. The Mozart museum, the hidden
                corners of the city, and the many exhibitions await another chapter of discovery. Vienna's cultural
                embrace is one that beckons travellers like myself to return, to learn, and to appreciate the enduring
                legacy of this remarkable city.
                <br><br>
                My Erasmus year continues, promising new adventures and encounters, but Vienna will forever hold a
                special place in my heart as a city that enriched my understanding of culture, art, and the boundless
                possibilities of exploration.
