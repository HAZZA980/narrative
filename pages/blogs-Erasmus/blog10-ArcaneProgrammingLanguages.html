                So, I’m currently attending Stockholm University as part of my Erasmus year in Sweden. This year is not
                only
                about travelling and experiencing new cultures but also about studying, like any other university
                experience.
                <br><br>
                The modules I chose in the first semester were vaguely related to Computer Science but wouldn’t benefit
                me
                in the long run, nor would they ever be needed in any career I choose. (Knowledge Management & Design
                Information and Society if you’re interested.)
                <br><br>
                This semester, one of the modules I have selected is Programming Languages and Paradigms. This is the
                first
                module I’ve opted for which I thought would have a perennial impact on any job I fall into when I leave
                university. That was the expectation but it hasn’t come to fruition.
                <br><br>
                This is because the primary language which we were learning was Prolog. Prolog, literally 'Programming
                in
                Logic'—heard of it? Well, if you haven’t, it is totally understandable. It is used for AI and
                computational
                linguistics. Prolog is based on formal logic, particularly first-order predicate calculus, and it's
                designed
                for symbolic computation and symbolic reasoning tasks. All of which, I don’t have a problem with.
                <br><br>
                The issue I have is the language is used by less than 0.2% of all companies which makes the prospect of
                my
                having to use it after the module extremely unlikely. Prolog was created in the early 70s so to state
                that
                more ubiquitous languages have taken its place is not an egregious lie.

                There are of course other programming languages from the 70s which are still going strong like C,
                Pascal,
                Lisp, etc. At least if I was learning these languages, they share the same syntactic format as the
                languages
                which have preceded them. Prolog is an aberration and has such esoteric use cases, I am perplexed at why
                I
                am having to master it in the space of four weeks just to forget it by Easter.
                <br><br>
                Before starting University, I thought I would be learning omnipresent languages such as Python, and C++.
                Languages which will always be useful and are versatile to stand its ground against nascent emerging
                technologies and languages. In my first year of uni, I learnt Scala. Again, Scala is not a well-known
                language but it at least shares similar syntax and programming paradigms with Java and C. Therefore when
                I
                moved onto learning the basics of Object Oriented Programming in my second year, making the switch to
                Java
                was almost seamless. Also they both run on the JVM.
                <br><br>
                It frustrates me how universities, to show that they are unique, pick archaic programming languages
                which
                will not be relevant in the industry unless we go into an extremely specialised job, just so they can
                add
                that to the list of USPs for the university. If they insist on doing that, the least they could do is
                choose
                a language which shares characteristics with a popular language so we are not starting from a tabula
                rasa
                when we leave university and start job hunting. It also doesn’t prepare us for the coding interviews
                because
                one-purpose languages are not ubiquitous anymore. Normally, we need to use Python, Java, PHP or a
                variation
                of C to solve the coding puzzles. Anyway rant over, I’ve got to go and learn the rules and syntax of
                Prolog…
