    <p>This summer I decided to go to the Sierra Nevada mountains to live with a host family for a few weeks. I
        wanted to spend my time productively over the summer by continuously expanding my horizons after my Erasmus

                No place is it more acceptable to be having a pint at any hour of the day than in an airport. I am
                sitting in the departure lounge of Newcastle International Airport waiting for my gate information which
                isn’t due to be displayed for over an hour. After leisurely walking through duty free and trying on a
                few pairs of excessively priced designer sunglasses, I now have nothing but time to kill. Like with all
                flights, I never sleep well the night before. Whether it is my subconscious warning me that a Lost-like
                scenario is imminent and I need to remain vigil, or it is nerves about what I am going abroad to do. My
                head is spinning, my eyes are drowsy and, honestly, it’s a miracle I’m forming coherent sentences at
                half four in the morning.
                <br><br>
                The game plan never changes. It was instilled in us as children by our fathers and their fathers before
                then and their fathers before them. ‘Get to the airport early and you can sleep when you’re there.’
                Meanwhile, I don’t see how this is remotely possible after having to go through the ordeal of airport
                check-in. Navigating the slalom of the self check-in machines is enough to send the weakest among us
                into a tailspin. Those of us who are blessed with being technology savvy are penalised, being thrown
                into this maelstrom of 70s technology and a world of print out boarding passes. Newcastle Airport, along
                with most, have done their utmost best to adapt to the times, but the digital scanners are not sensitive
                enough to scan a barcode off a digital screen and I am left staring at the screen, taunting me to place
                my boarding pass in the machine. Grandma and Grandpa are smiley prodigiously as they storm by me, no
                doubt laughing at my attempt to streamline the check-in process.
                <br><br>
                With the assistance of one of the two TUI staff who are overwhelmed in questions and stress, I am
                heading for security. Feeling light as a feather with only my meticulously organised backpack. Ready to
                pour everything out for the x-rays which evidently can’t recognise the difference between a Kindle and a
                remote control bomb. Double-checking all my pockets to make sure I haven’t accidentally snuck a one
                litre water bottle in my back pocket. I strip off, belt, shoes, jumper, glasses, only to get selected
                for a manual search anyway. ‘Would you like to see my penis here or in the back?’ It was my first pat
                down. He had a surprisingly gentle touch. Meanwhile, my tray of valuables is being checked by a member
                of the security team. She looks me up and down, judging whether I look like the type of person to try
                and pull anything beneath her radar. Her darting eyes are always on the lookout, ready to pounce at the
                first sign of trouble. She looked scary enough so she won’t be getting any trouble from me. ‘What is
                this?’ she asks, holding my Kindle enveloped in a flowery case. ‘It’s only a Kindle,’ I replied.
                “Kindle, huh.’ It clearly stimulated her acuitus mind. Determining it safe to board a plane, I am waved
                on. Physically unharmed but mentally confused. I promise I’m not a bad guy. I don’t deserve this
                treatment.
                <br><br>
                My flight isn’t until 6:05am. It is currently 4:30. What to do, what to do. Newcastle Airport is
                bustling and full of life. Eager Geordies looking to fly from their homeland to invade the blissful
                shores of Magaluf or Ibiza. Every type of young thug haircut is surrounding me. I’d better keep a tight
                grasp on my laptop. They might try and steal it in order to buy a Witherspoon's breakfast. What else is
                there to do but have an idle around duty free and the overpriced Airport shops. Who walked through an
                Airport and thinks now is the perfect time to buy a six-foot tall teddy bear? Obviously the children
                running around like it’s their first time out at night. Parents trying their best to subdue their
                child’s excitement. ‘If you don’t behave, then we’ll be going home.’ Does this ever work or is this
                empty threat enough to scare the child into submission? I tried to sleep, but I am too conscious one of
                these skinheads with sticky fingers will perform a daring heist for my bag. I am following my father’s
                advice to be vigilant. This untenable virgil till my gate number is displayed.
                <br><br>
                Airports never seem to put me at ease.. I don’t know what to do if I get there early. Normally, I travel
                light. An under-the-seat backpack with a spare pair of shorts and a t-shirt. Perfectly adequate for a
                week away. I can turn up twenty minutes before my flight is due to board and I am straight through.
                Storming through the airport with purpose and the bystanders know this by my dominating gait. However,
                that isn’t the case this time. I am travelling to Malaga to then get the train to Granada in order to
                catch the bus to Guejar Sierra. Why you may ask? Well, I am staying with a host family which I’ve found
                on Workaway: a website which advertises cultural experiences on foreign soil. Since I returned from my
                Erasmus year in Stockholm, it has been in the back of my mind to do something like this. I knew I wanted
                to go to Spain to learn the language. That way I have something to show for my time away. A new skill
                which offers the potential to open more opportunities in my career. This was something which I
                inevitably missed out on during the past year in Stockholm. Barricading my flat during the winter months
                to protect myself against the minus twenty weather was not what I was expecting when I left last August.
                This time, I want something to show for my time away.
                <br><br>
                Of course, I postponed this life changing experience till after the Euros. I needed to be home to watch
                England perform dismally in the final. I might have gotten hanged if I was in Spain and by some miracle,
                we had won. Thankfully, the Spaniards will be too inebriated to notice yet another foreigner slip under
                their mist. As long as I stay clear of Barcelona because tourists are being assaulted there. Its
                semblance is closer to Trump’s America rather than King Felipe’s Spain.
                <br><br>
                I intensified my search for hosts early July and started messaging an innumerable number of hosts. All
                had intriguing projects underway. After a lot of setbacks from promising placements, I finally got a
                response from Caroline. After a few short messages and a half an hour call, Caroline decided to let me
                stay rent free in exchange for a paltry amount of work. Painting, dog walking, cooking – menial tasks
                which are time consuming for her to do. Her thirteen year old son was also mentioned on her profile but
                if a thirteen year old still needs a babysitter, I think he needs the kind of help which I can’t
                provide.
                <br><br>
                Why am I doing this? The answer which I will use in job interviews would be something like, to enrich my
                knowledge of a different culture and learn the traditions and religions of the indigenous people. That
                gravitas makes recruiters think I’m staying in wood shelters and bringing hope to the poor natives. In
                contrast, there is no particular reason except for wanting to learn Spanish. Anything else I learn
                whilst I’m there is superfluous and will no doubt be forgotten by Christmas. I did have a spell of
                fervently learning Spanish during the pandemic but staring at a screen and translating sentences such as
                ‘the monkey is driving to the bank to meet his friends’ isn’t a likely phrase which will aid me in
                fluency. Complete immersion is the only way to achieve my goal. The village they live in is situated
                around twenty minutes from Granada but has all the amenities needed in order to get the necessities.
                Caroline herself is Dutch, and because of the Dutch Calvinistic propensity to learn English, we have no
                problem communicating. Her son, Javier, however knows English although I am unsure what level of
                proficiency he’s at. Caroline and her son were not the only hosts. There were others who I had messaged
                but for inauspicious reasons, they were not a good fit. Mainly because they had a very singular image of
                the person which they wanted. A master craftsman who will build a shed free of charge or a mechanic who
                can turn a Ford Cortina into a Mustang. That sort of thing. Caroline being fluent in English is a good
                omen as she can teach and correct my Spanish instead of having to communicate using hand signals and
                playing charades in order to have conversations. Until I meet her, I am holding my breath for a positive
                stay.

                Why have children if you can’t contain them? Indifference is not an option when your child’s behaviour
                is so indecorous that even the stewardess needs to intervene. The three hour flight to Malaga
                International Airport was fully booked. Customary to my airport rituals, I waited till I was the last
                one to board the plane. I do this, not because I’m superstitious or as an ominous premonition, but
                plainly because it’s a three hour flight and I don’t want to be sat down for longer than I need to be.
                The chairs are uncomfortable, the people are unsociable and the pilots don’t even greet you onto the
                plane anymore. My sleep deprivation reared its head at just the right time, knocking me out for two
                thirds of the flight. All was simpatico in the cabin, until Tommy, the little raskell sat in front of
                me, started to throw a tantrum. Pandemonium. <br><br>
                That was the end of the serenity, the mutual respect we passengers had for each other. It was every man,
                woman and child for themselves. Having been rudely
                awoken by the screams of the feral child, it was like we had suddenly hit turbulence but instead of
                wind, it was an anti-social contagion. The equilibrium of TUI flight 2343 was shattered. Tommy’s mother
                was deeply enjoying her latest Colleen Hoover book, (which I can hardly blame her for) and Tommy’s
                father was engrossed in watching an orgy which normally would be deemed inappropriate, but because it
                was The Boys, no one batted an eyelid. Except the geriatric woman who had a constant look of askance
                painted across her countenance. From my angle, I could tell if it was pleasure or disgust. Any who, they
                left Tommy running wild. The flight crew were losing their patience. I’m pretty sure they wanted to
                restrain the kid – or eject him. Also, they were selling cigarettes on the flight. I thought this was
                expedient in this day and age. What is this, the seventies? Meanwhile, I had the guy behind me swinging
                on my chair every time he stood up. Baby’s started crying, the flight crew kept jolting me awake by
                knocking the drinks cart into me every time they went up and down the aisle. I suppose I was collateral
                damage for when they were avoiding Tommy and his posse. My sleep was ruined with just under an hour
                remaining. The only allegory what I can think of for this ordeal to justify telling this story is:

                What the hell am I doing? The realisation has only just dawned on me. I am on bus number two out of four
                in order to get to my host’s house, (that in itself is a challenge). Malaga was the best option -well,
                cheapest, so I need to travel another two or three hours to actually get to Guejar Sierra. I don’t even
                know where that is, I’m just hoping for Google maps to produce a hail Mary to save me. When viewing the
                repertory of what has happened so far. I’ve travelled to a different country under the pretence of
                helping a random woman. I don’t have a surname, nor an address. The mutual decision for me to come over
                to help her out was only made last Saturday. Two days later we had a short video call in conjunction
                with the Workaway website guidelines to determine whether either of us were murderers or thieves. Based
                on that hastened denouement, I booked flights and less than half a week later and I’m travelling to an
                unknown city to meet unknown people. Irrespective of my previous scruples, one thing is certain. It’s
                going to be an experience. If, by my bad fortune, she does have serial killer proclivities, I will have
                travelled an comically circuitous route just to leave the same way. Succinctly - maybe it would have
                been prosperous to carry out further due diligence before committing. Reassuringly, she received
                positive feedback from previous volunteers, however, they were dated over four years ago when she lived
                in a different place. Now, the cynics amongst you will now be asking, why did she leave? What was the
                impetus for the change of scenery? What or who is she running from? All will be discerned in appropriate
                time… if I live to tell the tale.
                <br><br>
                The important thing to remember throughout this experience is my overall goal. Conversational in
                Spanish. Of course, I will be doing the odd few jobs, keeping the flat tidy, painting, walking the dog,
                all to earn my keep, but that still leaves a vast amount of time to myself. If I am serious about being
                fluent, I need to dedicate myself to it. That’s why I didn’t bring my iPad. It’s a constant source of
                procrastination. All I have is my laptop, camera and phone to entertain myself with. Laptop to code.
                Camera to take landscape pictures. Phone to call a cab to leave. The next four weeks are going to be the
                most dedicated and enthusiastic I have ever been.

                Great news, Carolina and Javier not murders or criminals. Or if they are, they are polite enough to be
                closeted murders and criminals so they don’t set the wrong tone for my arrival. Caroline is a cordial
                and affable woman. Once I finally arrived, and her meetings had finished, she gave me the tour around
                the modestly small apartment. For what it lacks in square footage, it makes up for with views. If Guejar
                Sierra proliferates into a city one day, this apartment will be like overlooking the Hollywood hills.
                Add a few more zero’s onto that price tag as well. Caroline works for a recruitment firm specifically in
                the technology sector, which is a serendipitous bit of luck. I may be calling on her services in the
                future if I want to move to Spain. Her son, Javier, keeps himself to himself. Taciturn would be
                erroneous to describe him. He just prefers to speak in Spanish which I am not adequate in yet. Four
                weeks time; we’ll be speaking every day. He is a carbon copy of myself at thirteen. Addicted to video
                games and going out to play football at every opportunity. I don’t see much of him but I mostly hear
                him. Only because he is losing at Fifa. I would go in and teach him my skills accumulated from over a
                decade of experience but as a wise man once said: Help must be solicited, not dictated to. If no one
                famous said that, then I’m claiming it.

                I should also mention that I didn’t accomplish the challenge of navigating to the Guejar Sierra
                mountains. I capitulated to the heat and called an Uber. I hadn’t eaten a substantial meal, had half a
                bottle of water and a host that was busy working so couldn't come and pick me up… What would you have
                done?

                Now that I unpacked and settled in for a few days, I can have a moment of introspection. When driving up
                to the village in Guejar Sierra, the first thing to strike me was the idyllic nature of the area. The
                roads weaved around the base of the mountains which made it a slow journey so I had time to take photos
                from the back seat. I had an address for Caroline but I hadn’t looked at it on a map. To my surprise,
                the apartment is the highest one overlooking the entire village. This may sound great and that it’s an
                expensive house, similar to royalty overlooking their citiedels but no. It is a compact flat which is a
                full workout just to get to from the village square. This is a route which I am having to do every
                morning in order to fill up my water bottles and do my shopping. Caroline and Javier are very
                accommodating. When they speak Spanish, they speak slowly so I can try and understand, even if they are
                not directly talking to me. We have our routines established. I normally take the dog, Niquito, out for
                his morning and evening walks whilst Caroline is working. She is a manager at a recruitment firm so
                works around six hours a day but at different times. It is fully remote and she is liaising with
                colleges from different countries, hence the obscure working hours. Since it is the summer holidays,
                Javier is struggling to entertain himself. He shuts himself in his room and plays Playstation until the
                early hours of the morning to pass the time. Over the past few days he hasn’t awoken till around lunch
                so I try to be quiet around the flat. Since I have brought my camera, I have been taking plenty of
                landscape photos on long walks. I haven’t done any of the hiking trails adorning the mountains because
                even though I can see them from the apartment, they are actually around fifteen miles away. I still
                haven’t sussed out public transport after my debacle on the first day either. I have no reason to leave
                Guejar Sierra just yet but I will be going to explore Granada at some point with Caroline.
                <br><br>
                Now for my pet peeves. When I arrived, the room where I am sleeping was not cleaned. I know this is a
                small thing but it would have been appreciated if it was tidied. The previous guest who had stayed for
                around six months left a number of belongings which had started to smell in the wardrobe. The room had
                been absent for over a month so it was plenty of time to wash and hoover the room. It wouldn’t have
                taken long given the 5sqm floor space. Because of this, I didn’t actually unpack my suitcase until
                yesterday. I wanted the room tidy to my standards before getting settled. The unscrupulous cleaning is a
                general occurrence throughout the flat. Everything is grimey. Pots and pans and not washed, only rinsed
                before being placed back in the cupboards. Niquito obviously lives indoors because of the unforgiving
                heat outside during the day but that isn’t an excuse to not keep the general cleanliness in a moderate
                state. I was feeling a little disappointed on my second day, given the dirty nature of the apartment. I
                was maybe a little homesick too. I have always appreciated how much my parents have done for me and the
                life they have given me, but I know that I need to experience this side of life too. Not everything can
                be served to me on fine China plates. Here in Guejar Sierra, food is very different to the UK. I imagine
                it would be very different compared to Madrid too. Because it is a village, we don’t have meat in
                supermarkets, only the village butchers so Caroline comes home with a bag of meat and when it comes to
                cooking it, I don’t know if I am looking at a sirloin steak or pork loins. Food in general has always
                been a constant adversary for me and here in Spain I know that my portion sizes have shrunk back to
                minimal sizes. Caroline has offered to cook for me but I have very particular eating habits which I know
                have stymied me in the past, but there is not a lot I can do to assuage myself. Normally, I sort my own
                meals out and do the cleaning afterwards. Partly because I want to be helpful to earn my keep, but
                partly because I know otherwise, the pans won’t get a thorough cleaning.
                <br><br>
                Caroline has kindly told me what other jobs she would like doing. Hanging a few shelves and coat hooks.
                Organising the balcony - menial tasks which I am only too happy to oblige. So far there has been no
                mention of painting like I had originally thought which I am secretly pleased about. I have a walk
                around the village every day and so it makes sense if I take Niquito with me. He doesn’t need much
                exercise so I don’t take him everywhere. He also has this ignominious habit of liking his balls in
                public but not in the apartment. He’s like some sort of quadrupedal flasher. Since he’s not neutered
                either, he has a good time with the bollards when we pass them - and exhaust pipes.
                <br><br>
                Despite the cleanliness issue, it is going fine so far. I have started picking up some more words in
                Spanish even though I am not forming coherent sentences yet. The village life is quiet but the night
                life is normally quite buzzing. Other cultural differences such as only being able to get fresh water
                from the fountains are easily adaptable to but my biggest hurdle is the food. I was having my doubts, if
                I had made the right decision to come to Guejar Sierra. Would I have been better off in the city, or any
                city for that matter. I told myself that learning Spanish would be better in a rural village though
                right now, I am not too sure. Although it is a few weeks away, I need to start thinking about getting
                flights home before they get too expensive and then I find myself in the same position as I was when
                flying out to Spain. However I am in two minds about when and where to go. Initially, I was wanting to
                spend at least a month here in Spain but I think food is going to be the prime reason for my early
                departure. Secondly, I was considering flying to Madrid to spend three or four days in the capital as a
                detour. When searching on flight company websites, it is easier departing from Madrid to Newcastle than
                to London. I am fervently trying to avoid London because I know the UK train will cost more than the
                flights combined. Whatever I choose to do, I hope I do brave it out and stay for at least one full
                month, whether that is here in Guejar Sierra or even in Madrid too. One last revelation, Caroline is not
                Dutch. She only speaks it because she is actually Belgian. Who knew?

                I didn’t have the great night’s sleep last night. It was the first night that I had my sleep
                interrupted. I went to bed around midnight along with the others and Niquito followed me into my room.
                When asked, I normally say ‘Yes, I am a dog lover’, but in reality, I’m more laissez faire when around
                them. Pushing him out the door didn’t help because then he kept scratching and purring. Do dogs purr?
                When I opened the door, he lept straight on my bed and got comfortable. Clearly, I had taken his spot
                since moving in. After pleading with him to leave, his intransigence was overwhelming. I eventually
                acquiesced and tried to find a comfortable position around him. A couple of sleep cycles later, I was
                overheating. Niquito was resting his head on my legs and it was too hot for any interaction at all.
                Trying my best not to kick him in the face, I manoeuvred him back to the foot of the bed. After he
                interrupted my sleep again half an hour later, I lifted him off the bed and laid him down outside my
                door, hoping he would be too tired to start purring again. At this point, I was overheating so I opened
                the sliding doors to get some fresh air in. Even though it was still 22 degrees outside, it did help. A
                few hours later, I was startled, waking me up yet again. This time by one of the cats had sauntered into
                my room and jumped on my bed. Letting out a manly yelp, I jumped into action to remove the feline and
                ushed her back outside. Locking the sliding doors, I was adamant that I wouldn’t be woken up again.
                Caroline was up early to take Javi to his summer camp and with their shuffling and stomping, it woke me
                up too. I couldn’t get back to sleep so instead I got up. Taking my revenge on Niquito, I woke him up
                too and took him on a two hour hike. Little bastard won’t be waking me up again. But looking back at
                this ordeal, it’s time for another parable:

                It has taken me a few days but I am acclimatising to the Spanish modus operandi. In the UK, I would
                consider myself an early bird, preferring to wake up around seven or eight in order to see the sun
                before midday. Here however, things are a little different. Because of the constant heat, most Spaniards
                wake up at eleven and go to bed in the early hours in the morning so they are benefitting from the
                cooler air around nine or ten in the evenings. This change of routine impacts the eating schedules too.
                Caroline and Javi normally eat their main meal of the day around three pm. Thankfully, neither are
                vegetarians, pescatarian or have any other dietary requirements. Eating in foreign places is hard enough
                for me without being limited to certain food groups. Even Niquito abides by these schedules. He is
                trained so has to be taken out twice a day. Every morning I am out exploring the area and judging by
                Niquito’s body language, he is not accustomed to taking circuitous walks for over twenty minutes.
                <br><br>
                Guejar Sierra is perched on the side of a mountain so I am going on a workout with him everyday. He
                comes back
                to the apartment and has his daily siesta for the next four hours. Caroline took Javi to his summer camp
                today in Granada to occupy him and she is working remotely in the park in the city. She messaged me to
                ask if I could cook some food for when they returned mid afternoon. Erm, okay. What do I cook? What can
                I cook? She left some Euros so I could buy some meat for the village so I guess that’s the plan. After a
                lot of ruminating, I opted for Shepherds pie. Traditional, British, standard, shepherd’s pie. After
                stoving in the hot kitchen for over an hour, both Caroline and Javi seemed to enjoy it. Or if they were
                just being polite, they are incredibly good actors. Meanwhile, I’ve started doing the odd few jobs
                around the flat; taking the bins out, washing and drying up, walking Niquito. Painting has not been
                mentioned so I am quietly pleased about that.

                Caroline took Javi to his summer camp again this morning which allowed me to get up in my own time.
                Frosties for breakfast and the morning chores. Refilling the cat bowl with food and water. Clean the
                kitchen, and then go out with Niquito for a walk, snapping photos as I go. I am still on my UK schedule
                vis-a-vis eating routines and therefore still getting familiar with the Spanish siesta. I dropped
                Niquito back off at the apartment and then headed out again. Caroline and Javi normally return from
                Granada around 3pm and even though it wasn’t explicitly mentioned, Caroline was expecting food on the
                table upon her arrival. I suspected this, so this was the impetus to make sure I was out. I took my
                camera and headed for the nearest mountains. Going out during the hottest time of the day where the
                humidity is usually in the high thirties is certainly not something I am comfortable with. According to
                my phone, I covered 4.8km and took 5849 steps in around two hours. Catching up on my podcasts which I
                let slip during June and July is getting me through the hikes.
                <br><br>
                As expected, I did get a few acrimonious
                words from Caroline who wasn’t happy about not being fed. Well tough tits. You should have explicitly
                said you wanted me to cook. I did think about cooking but there is actually nothing which I can make
                which I know they will like. She is trying not to eat carbs and therefore restricts her diet to meat and
                vegetables but there is only a certain number of dishes one can make using the same ingredients. Stir
                fry or a stew. Normally, I see to myself because I know I am picky therefore, I eat simple to make,
                basic meals, but I doubt my Spanish hosts would appreciate an unseasoned chicken and potatoes. After my
                caution, I wanted to do something that would prove that I am earning my keep. I went to put up a trio of
                small mirrors which I was going to hang on the walls. Caroline told me that a few screws in the wall
                would do. Following her direction, I went to screw in the screws with the newly acquired drill she had
                bought and soon hit a brick wall. Literally. Resorting to the good-old-fashioned hammer and nail
                technique, she proceeds to tell me that she has no nails - or a hammer. So off to a rocky start on the
                DIY front. I have managed to walk Niquito and keep the two cats alive in her absence in the mornings so
                that counts for something I hope. Was it two or three cats she had?

                Sometimes I need to pinch myself to remind myself that this is real. I’m staying in a stranger's house,
                in a foreign place, eating local produce and walking unknown streets in the mountains of the Sierra
                Nevada. Stockholm was an amazing experience but I had a room to myself so I could go days without
                speaking. A self-induced isolation for when I wanted to be alone. In the year which I was there, I don’t
                think I ever heard or saw any of my neighbours. Now I get woken up by Javier screaming over conceding a
                goal in Fifa. I was addicted to Xbox as well at his age but I had the common courtesy to send polemics
                directly to my opponents instead of shouting at the TV. Diatribes are futile if there is no one to hear
                them. (I learnt that young). I am wanting to do the jobs which Caroline wants me to do, like the DIY
                jobs, but they are more than just standard DIY. It requires knowledge which only a professional
                tradesman has. Such as swapping a plug for a USB plug. Perhaps if we were in England, I would be
                comfortable giving it a go because I’ve seen my Dad do it in my room, but not in Spain which runs on a
                totally different electrical system.
                <br><br>
                Also Caroline suggested I do this whilst she’s in a meeting which
                indicates to me that she expects me to magically do it without turning the power off. This was the first
                time that I needed to say ‘No, I’m not doing that.’ She also wants me to change the plug socket for the
                light outside which requires a professional sparky, not a foreign volunteer found online. On paper, this
                ostensible looked like a good fit. We eat all the same foods, enjoy the same things, darts and formula
                one, but we were unclear of our expectations for each other. I wanted her to teach me Spanish which she
                doesn’t have time to do because of her labyrinthine work schedule and she wants a professional tradesman
                to come in and do a number of jobs in her apartment. Since she moved into this place a few months ago,
                she has been trying to get someone to do these jobs but I have recommended hiring someone. Her
                countenance suddenly changed almost to say ‘well why are you staying with me then?’ I don’t think I can
                blame her. In conjunction with this, I don’t think my stay will be as long as I have anticipated. All I
                can do is enjoy the time whilst I am here. Taking photos and trying to soak up the Spanish sun.

                Most mornings, I am left to get up in my own time. That is after I am woken by either the cats purring
                for food on my balcony or Caroline and Javi banging around to leave the apartment by 8:15. I am still
                operating on English time, therefore I have breakfast when I get up. I am only here for another week and
                a half so I’m not going to drastically change my normal habits just to immerse myself fully into Spanish
                culture. Normally, I find myself having to shut Niquito in one of the bedrooms whilst I have breakfast
                because he tries to jump on the table or hump my leg. Either way, it’s very distracting. Then he starts
                to bark if I don’t take him out within half an hour. After Caroline and Javi leave, Niquito just sits
                outside my door waiting to go. The weather is very humid irrespective of the time we go out but I find
                it more bearable in the mornings than the evenings which is why I find it confounding that the Spanish
                inclination is to wake up late and go to bed late. When I am walking Niquito in the evening, the
                temperatures don’t precipitously drop as everyone ostensibly thinks. Clearly, I just don’t have the
                Spanish motivation to keep telling myself this.
                <br><br>
                I’ve realised that we seem to pass the same people on the streets. Many are geniatric folk and don’t
                move at all. They sit on their deck chairs when we pass them in the morning and ten hours later on our
                evening walk, they are still there. I exchange an effervescent ‘Hola’ in my best Spanish accent and
                hastily continue walking so they don’t have time to retort with a Spanish sentence which I won’t
                understand.
                <br><br>
                Because I am here under the guise of working in exchange for free rent and food, I do my best to
                accomplish my tasks. I keep the apartment tidy and have lunch ready for when Caroline and Javi return
                mid-afternoon. My day-to-day tasks include: replenishing the food for the pets, dog walking,
                washing/drying up and occasionally hanging washing out. I must remember to refill the cat food last
                thing on an evening because they seem to be nocturnal and otherwise they will keep me away with their
                purring.
                <br><br>
                My main task for today was to hang a coat rack on the back of my door and fish the drawers in Caroline’s
                room. (The bottom keeps falling out). The latter was an easy job - just tightening the cam locks but the
                former took some ingenuity. The drill which Caroline bought specifically for me to do her list of jobs
                is ill-equipped to handle them as most require drilling into brick or concrete. However, putting holes
                in a wooden door was something which was possible. It would have been a simple job if not for the cheap
                screws which Caroline gave me which got rounded off under the first ouch of pressure. This ten minute
                job soon proliferated into an hour job and a trip to the local DIY store. A trip made infinitely harder
                when trying to communicate in a different language. Despite these hiccups, the jobs got done.
                <br><br>
                For the rest of the day, I have been either reading or going on walks. There isn’t a surplus of
                activities on offer since this village only spans less than one square mile but I make my own
                entertainment. I finally have a departure date too: August 4th. I am ruminating whether to be honest
                with Caroline or fabricate an excuse to explain my premature departure. That’s a conversation for
                another day.

                So up until this point, I was under the impression that Javi did not speak English. Well this is
                technically correct but today I heard him speak English to his friends online so there must have been a
                time when he was fluent and he only remembers memorable words. With Caroline out doing a river hike, I
                am left keeping an eye on Javi but I leave him to his own devices playing Xbox. Evidently, he isn’t very
                good and I often hear him smashing and screaming in his room. The few English words I hear him say are
                the only English words which even I’m not allowed to say. Yes, I’m talking about the racial epithets.
                Most sentences are in Spanish but when he dies or concedes, (I don’t know which game he’s playing), an
                English polemic is unleashed. He is thirteen so I don’t know if he thinks it means something different
                or he just thinks that it is fine because he isn’t being racist in his own language. The latter, I
                think, is worse but I don’t know. I was as addicted as he is to the Xbox but I don’t remember screaming
                and throwing tantrums when I lose. I certainly didn’t resort to breaking my controllers or punching
                holes in the wall. I am leaving him to it because I can’t have the conversation alone with him
                admonishing him for using inappropriate language. Also, there is a high possibility that he will resort
                to playing dumb and pretend he doesn’t understand me like what he has done in the past. Caroline is
                still confident that Javi can speak fluent English but I think this is an outdated belief. I don’t doubt
                that he has been fluent once upon a time in order to remember the words he can but he has all but
                forgotten since he has been living in Spain for the best part of a decade.

                I was told this morning that a friend of Caroline’s was staying for one night. Since I’m occupying the
                spare bedroom, he has to make do with the couch. I’m currently unsure of the dynamic of this
                relationship. Friend? Boyfriend? When I arrived back from a particularly stressful walk with Niquito,
                Benjamin was unpacking his backpack in the lounge. He must be mid to late thirties based on the receding
                hairline and the style of branded polo shirts he wore. He was only passing through for one night so it
                would only be a brief encounter. Caroline cooked this delicious meat stew for us which didn’t stretch
                four ways. Since I’m the guest, I thought it was prudent to sacrifice my portion to give to Javi. Was he
                thankful? Succinctly, no. Benjamin has a plethora of stories from his days backpacking and couchsurfing.
                He is a native Iranian but moved to Spain five years ago after the middle east became increasingly
                hostile again.
                <br><br>
                He is the paragon of an old man with a young soul. He’s never settled down, got a
                mortgage and a car. The digital nomad life suits him. He has this great philosophy that life should be
                based around experiences instead of conforming to social norms. “Work shouldn't be the centre of our
                lives, making us happy with just a few holidays a year. We should be travelling and working remotely to
                enrich ourselves every day, not just for a couple of weeks each year.” I think he’s preaching a valuable
                lesson but ignoring a number of human behavioural traits. Most people need structure, routine and
                comfort. All of which can be found by settling down in one place. Holidays are there to break the
                monotony. As much as I like travelling and seeing new places, I think I need the structure otherwise I
                can’t differentiate my work/life balance. He certainly made me think what my life would be like as a
                digital nomad though. Learning languages from natives, moving city to city, seeing the world. It’s
                incredibly enticing - or beguiling.

                I have never had a night like last night. Ever. I wanted to experience the bustling nightlife in the
                Sierra Nevada, so I followed Caroline and Benjamin to the village for the Saturday night festivities.
                For a village that is normally quiet, it comes alive on the weekends. The little village square fills
                with families, pets, and couples, both young and old. Everyone comes together. Everyone knows everyone.
                The bar tables are set out like the Last Supper, with everyone shuffling together and socializing with
                whomever they come into contact with. Caroline doesn't drink, which was good for me because I had a
                coherent translator when I needed her. Most people indulged me as I struggled through with broken
                Spanish, but most understood English anyway. My English accent perplexed some of them, but they were
                intrigued by English culture and quizzed me on regal history. I never thought I would be questioned on
                the House of Hanover in a little village in the south of Spain.
                <br><br>
                As the breeze cooled the air, the band started playing. There seemed to be an unspoken agreement (which
                Caroline later explained to me) that all the children and pets needed to leave at midnight. It was an
                unofficial curfew in place to allow the parents time away from their kids. With all the children and
                teenagers vacating the square, I could get a better grasp of the age demographic of the village.
                Normally, when I go out on my walks with Niquito, I see the same people: usually old folks, sitting in
                the same spot in the sun from dawn till dusk. This evening, I saw that after midnight is when my
                generation comes out to play. And that’s when my life turned into a movie.
                <br><br>
                I was sitting on the periphery of the square with Benjamin, watching everyone dancing and smiling.
                That’s when I heard the most beautiful sound I had ever heard. Maria... All the beautiful sounds of the
                world in a single word... Maria! She sat down next to me with her long locks and big blue eyes and asked
                me to dance. Taking my hand, she pulled me into the square with little resistance. The bachata is not a
                dance I was familiar with, as I whispered in her ear. But Maria, cunning and persistent Maria, taught
                me. Dancing is just maintaining rhythm, and thankfully, I have that in abundance. I was a quick study.
                We held each other close and moved as one. We sang and danced as the music played. This is living.
                Immersing oneself into the heart of Spanish culture. The thrill of learning new things and meeting new
                people. I don’t know if it was the alcohol in the air, the sound of the Latin music, or the buzz of
                dancing in a village square in the early hours of the morning, but it was intoxicating. We danced and
                danced until the music stopped. As the bachata is such an intimate affair, we ended our partnership with
                a kiss. Ironic how we were in Spain, but the kiss was <i>French</i>. I sauntered over to Benjamin, who
                was
                grinning as much as I was. He put his arm around me, "Oh, what I would do to be able to dance like that
                again—you lucky bastard." We ambled back to the apartment with a spring in our step, watching the light
                pass over the village, marking the start of a new day.

                Today has been a glimpse into the domestic family life which happens from time to time. It just so
                happened to coincide with the first thunderstorm since being here. Since last night was a late one,
                Caroline and myself have been resting for most of the day. I don’t sleep much anyway so I was walking
                Niquito at around 11 this morning. Caroline dropped Benjamin off at Granada bus station at the same
                time. He is travelling to Sevilla to go on a silent retreat. Very holistic indeed. I’ve been watching
                the F1 whilst Caroline caught up on her sleep, or tried to through Javi’s persistent screaming. Enough
                is enough, Caroline screamed back sending Javi into a toddler tantrum. Do teenagers still cry and winge
                like this? Did I? Having confiscated his Xbox, Javi was whimpering in his room but at least Caroline
                could get to sleep. I don’t know if it was a coincidence that all this happened just when the
                thunderstorm started. What seemed to be an aberration in the weather sent waves throughout the village,
                upsetting the equilibrium of everyone in the vicinity. I was keeping absent from this family affair but
                my ears kept pricking up because when Caroline shouts Javi, it sounds like Harry. A chill shoots up my
                spine when I think I’m next on her hit list. I think we need to get some fresh air to cool off.

                Another beautiful day in Guejar Sierra. The sun is shining, the birds are singing. All is well in the
                Sierra Nevada. After my brief encounter on Saturday night, I have never regretted not taking my phone
                with me so much. No number, no pictures, nothing but intangible memories of my night dancing in the
                square. It is premature to use the word solemate, but it is a reasonable thought vis-a-vis our night
                together. I’m hoping I will serendipitously encounter Maria again when I am out walking with Niquito but
                I don’t believe the universe is so kind. The locals have started recognising me and I am managing short
                conversations. I am assimilating enough Spanish to get me through day-to-day conversations, such as
                grocery shopping or making small talk about the weather or the village. Esta bien! I have acclimated to
                the heat too, which is a blessing. When I first arrived, I thought it was unbearable, however now, I can
                live with it. It’s Niquito who stops me from walking him between his siesta hours of three and six. This
                gives me the opportunity to go on a hike with my camera or down by the river. Village life is enjoyable
                when it’s tranquil and peaceful. In my spare time I have been reading and writing, hoping to improve my
                craft. I only have five days left here so I want to make every moment memorable.

            <p>
                I've been left alone with my thoughts for the past two days while Caroline has been taking Javi to
                appointments in Granada. Besides my daily chores like walking the dog and keeping the apartment tidy,
                I've been feeling somewhat unfulfilled. Living in a foreign country isn't the insurmountable challenge
                many perceive it to be. Based on my own experiences—spending a year in Stockholm and the past few weeks
                in Spain—I've realised that once the initial culture shock fades and a routine is established, life in
                Guejar Sierra shares many similarities with life in the UK. <br><br>
                I go out and practise my Spanish, cook meals using recipes from home, walk the dog, and experiment with
                my camera to test different apertures. This village is as idyllic as they come, but my mind feels
                unstimulated. For that reason, I've found fresh relief in coding again. It activates my brain and still
                falls under the broad umbrella of revision in preparation for my final year of university. It's a
                win-win. <br><br>
                Instagram may not be a reliable metric for reality, but I often see influencers "working" with their
                laptops on beaches or in glamping tents. I'm unsure of the correlation between productivity and
                environment, but for me, it makes no difference. If anything, I get irritated by the heat and become
                irascible. I've been working in the dark for most of the past two days because as soon as we open the
                shutters, the room turns into a sauna. <br><br>
                Travelling has become a new passion of mine, and it indeed broadens the mind. I've become more receptive
                to new cultures and more sociable with people from different backgrounds. However, I might need to keep
                these visits as temporary holidays because I'm doubtful that I could work effectively anywhere other
                than a proper working environment. (How mundane is that!) This affirms my thoughts after hearing
                Benjamin talk about his life of travelling. Certain people don't need a home or an anchor to remind them
                of their creature comforts. If digital nomads can work anywhere, it follows that they can live anywhere.
                Unfortunately for me, when I'm on holiday, I'm entirely in that mindset.

                After being here for over two weeks, I feel like I have finally adjusted to the status quo in the
                desert. The trepidation I had in the first few days was slowly assuaged and in the end, I just needed a
                little time to acclimatise to the culture shock of a traditional Spanish village. However, now I have
                found a daily routine with Caroline and Javi, I could stay for another month and it wouldn’t make a
                difference to me. However, my flight leaves in two days so I need to break it to Caroline and hopefully
                they don’t get too disheartened about my premature departure. Though I think I am being quixotic when I
                say this. Personally, I think it will be Niquito who misses me the most since it is I who is walking and
                feeding him most days. Goodbye my little shagger.

                So today is my last day in the Guejar Sierra and I thought this would be the potent opportunity to
                reflect on my motivations, what I’ve learnt and other signs of growth and development. After a rocky
                start and adjusting to the change of scenery, it is important to recognise that just because something
                is difficult to begin with, doesn’t mean it will remain hard to adapt. Resilience is something which
                everyone is good at and yet so oblivious to. Moving to a new environment brings the same feelings of
                trepidation and apprehension irrespective of whether you're moving house or emigrating to a foreign
                country. The differences in routine can be a difficult storm to weather but with time, a new routine
                will be established. In my time in the Guejar Sierra, the first week or so proved to be more difficult
                than I had anticipated. I have never had the experience of living with people, especially strangers.
                Understandably, it took time to adjust to each other and learn the house rules.
                <br><br>
                Given that the raison d'etre for my being there was to be another pair of hands, I found it incumbent to
                help wherever I could. There were certain jobs which I couldn’t do based on the tools which were
                supplied but after explaining the issues, we were able to come to an agreement which was amenable for
                both of us.
                <br><br>
                I have no negatives to express in regards to the village. It’s a paragon of Spanish culture, being home
                to almost 3000 people. Many of which were amicable and patient when I was struggling through a Spanish
                sentence, however similar to all things. There were individuals who couldn’t understand any English at
                all and therefore didn’t welcome my presence in their village. Despite its paltry size, it still
                accommodates everyone’s needs with a number of Butchers, grocery stores, fish markets and other
                essential establishments like pharmacies and banks. (Though the bank is rather superfluous since every
                shop only accepts cash payments.)
                <br><br>
                Niquito and I explored every thoroughfare and he took me up mountains and hiking trails which were great
                picture opportunities. Averaging over 6 miles, I covered almost every corner of the village. We saw the
                same people on our travels allowing me to practise my Spanish small talk. In terms of what I’ve learnt,
                it is impossible to distinguish a metric which can comprehensively measure everything which I have
                picked up but from my point of view, I think this has been a valuable experience in terms of
                adaptability and in taking great strides in achieving my overall goal of being fluent in Spanish. The
                phrases and speech patterns which I heard from the locals were the type of things which I expected to
                learn as it is hard to determine colloquial language from learning via Duolingo.
                <br><br>
                The question which I will assuredly be asked when divulging my tales of Spain is ‘Would I like to
                return.’ Short answer: Yes. Long answer: In a few years, possibly. I want to continue my Spanish journey
                but Spain is a big country with a wide profusion of people and cultures. As picturesque as the village
                was, it was tedious to get to from the closest airport, the public transport was reasonable but, at
                times, complicated to discern the right bus, and the village is an hour away from the closest city. I
                unequivocally enjoyed my time in the Sierra Nevada but I am a city boy at heart and will hope to explore
                the diversity of Madrid or Barcelona in my next trip to Espana.

                Three buses it took to get me to Malaga Airport. In order to make the 13:35 flight time, I was at the
                Guejar Sierra bus stop at 8am this morning. I thanked Caroline and Javi for their hospitality over the
                past three weeks and made the shallow offer to keep in touch. The buses themselves were not as intuitive
                as they should have been. I found this out upon arrival into Granada hence the need for an uber on the
                first day. The bus stops are poorly marked and if I hadn’t seen the A4 printed sheet of paper which had
                slid down the lamp post it was affixed to I would have missed my bus because I would have been waiting
                at the wrong place. For those interested, the sign said ‘This bus does not go up the plaza in the month
                of August.’ What’s the date: 4th August. Thankfully I did walk to the main roundabout where the first
                bus was waiting. Made it with seconds to spare. This bus was only to take me as far as the outskirts of
                Granada; I would then be boarding another to take me to the bus station where I would catch my final bus
                taking me to Malaga. The buses are free in Granada which makes a refreshing change, although the public
                transport is normally quite reasonable anywhere in Europe. Literally anywhere but the UK.
                <br><br>
                Three hours of bus travel later and I’m finally at Malaga Airport for midday. Remembering the queues to
                get through border control arriving into Spain, I thought I had messed up my timings. Genuinely thinking
                I would miss my flight, these fears only grew when I saw baggage check-in for RyanAir. The queue
                stretched past the 45 minute sign and that was the moment my heart sunk. I was definitely going to miss
                my flight. But then a hint of good fortune passed over me. The staff member was segregating people into
                lines based on if they had the RyanAir app or not. Being the tech-savvy gen Z which I am, I do
                everything digitally. I was ushered to the self check in which took a total of five minutes whilst the
                baby boomers were waiting with the other tech illiterates. Dancing through the self checkout I ploughed
                forth toward the security gates. Empirically judging from my experiences at various airports over the
                past year, Malaga is probably the worst organised. Standing in the middle of the foyer, there was no
                indication of where I should be heading. Watching a maelstrom of people being herded about, looking lost
                and following the crowd would have been comical if I wasn’t in the centre of all this. Thanks to the
                self check-in, I now had plenty of time so I could wander through the crowds like a lost puppy until I
                found the way.
                <br><br>
                I sat looking at my gate and I know I’m in the right place. I’m surrounded by my people. “Wei ayes” and
                “Nee bother pals” are in the common lexicon around me. Geordies have a certain look about them when they
                are on holiday. Sports shorts and a running shirt is the casual wear because that’s the thinnest
                clothing they own. A tan line which separates the pale white skin from their burnt red. We put a cloud
                over the elegance of the Spaniards and mall their idyllic cities by the plane load. Barcelona environs
                probably have the right philosophy by throwing water bombs and abusing tourists. It would be a perfectly
                sound thing to do because if I wasn’t geordie adjacent, I would feel the exact same. Their argument
                crumbles when you realised that 14% of the Barcelona GDP comes from tourists. That figure likely
                skyrockets towards the half century mark in Malaga from the Geordies alone. TV shows like Love Island
                and other cringy reality shows are likely the reason for the mass emigration to southern Spain during
                the summer.
                <br><br>
                My flight is boarding now but I won’t be moving for at least another twenty minutes. I only have a small
                carry-on bag so I am not wrestling somebody for locker space. I am hoping to sleep through most of the
                flight because I only had a few hours sleep last night. Hopefully this flight is more tolerable than the
                arriving flight. That means no little shits called Jimmy running rampant. I’ll keep you informed.

                So that's it. The end of my volunteering. Back on home soil; what a journey it’s been. Would I have
                thought that I could have done this a year ago. Definitely not. I may have my gripes about choosing
                Stockholm as the destination for my Erasmus year, but I have incontestably became a more sanguine and
                intrepid person because of it. I am now receptive to new opportunities and have this new mindset of
                throwing myself into the deep end because even if it does turn out to be a complete disaster, it will be
                an experience. My incipient temerity for travelling is something which I am proud of myself for doing
                but with this particular chapter of my life closing, it is time to get back into my studying mindset and
                focus on achieving my first in Computer Science. The past year has been a whirlwind at times and of
                course there were moments of anxiety and hesitation in some situations but overall I am pleased with the
                outcome and the places I’ve been. Seeing a show at the Vienna Opera house, visiting Van Gogh paintings
                in Amsterdam, learning the origins of the Nobel prize ceremony in Stockholm, being hit by cyclists in
                Copenhagen and being close to contracting frostbite in Oslo. I will continue to travel to see new places
                and hopefully continue my language journey but for now it’s back to University.
